learn about the major ethical values, the 
importance of ethical values and aspects 
of applied ethics such as professional 
ethics and environmental ethics.

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookLESSON  
1.1.     The meaning of ethics  
In everyday language, the distinction between the terms ‘ethics’ and ‘morality’ is 
not always clear.  Historically, the term ‘ethics’ comes from Greek ‘ethos’ which 
means the customs, habits and mores of people. Ethics is a discipline that deals with 
morality or it is a set of moral principles. From a theoretical or purely descriptive 
point of view, ethics is interested in the nature and origin of moral judgments. From 
a practical or prescriptive point of view, however, ethics is concerned with the 
particular norms, values or principles that ought to be used to arrive at proper moral 
judgments. Habitually all ethical questions involve a decision about what one should ⓵⓵
BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮What does ethical or unethical mean?
 偮Have you ever heard when someone says, “Mr. X is ethical or 
unethical person?”By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 ☑Define ethics
 ☑Explain why being ethical is important in your daily life 3
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookdo in a specific instance. Judgments about such decisions are generally expressed 
with words like right, and wrong, should and ought, and obligation and duty .
 Morality refers to the standards and principles used to determine the behaviors, 
decisions or actions of individuals as right or wrong, good or bad, acceptable or 
unacceptable. On the other hand, ethics is concerned with what is right or wrong, 
what is good or bad, or what is acceptable or not acceptable. Ethics is a human 
conduct and is applied in daily life to determine acceptable human behavior. It is 
concerned with what is good for individuals and society. Ethics impacts the behavior 
and demands an individual to take the right options. Managing life and acting 
responsibly is very hard without ethics.
Ethics also refers to those values and principles that oblige someone to refrain from 
unethical   acts such as rape, stealing, murder, assault, slander, and fraud. It includes 
the virtues of honesty, compassion, and loyalty and standards relating to rights, 
such as the right to life, the right to freedom from injury, and the right to privacy. 
Generally, ethics is a discipline that teaches us to follow the right way, to do the right 
thing and to refrain from bad or wrong doings.
There are three students called X, Y and Z who attend Grade 9, section 
‘A’.  Student ‘X’ is the smartest student who ranks first from all sections 
and in his batch. Student X and Z are sitting on the same bench in the 
class. From three of them, student Y and Z are best friends.  Accordingly, 
student Z asks student Y  to help him by coping the answers from the 
smartest student X during the final examiniation and to text him on  
mobile phone.  But, student Y got angry and disappointed with the act of 
student Z. He told to student Z that he could never help him in this way, 
even if they are best friends. ...... Case Study4
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook.....Case Study
Student Y believes that cheating in the exam is unethical act and serious 
academic dishonesty. Then, he advised student Z not to attempt cheating 
in the exams after this, and to work hard just like student X. Otherwise, 
he expressed that their friendship will come to an end.  Then, student 
Z highly regretted with unethical act he did. Finally, he apologized his 
friend and promised him not to repeat the same act in his future academic 
life.
Based on the above case study, attempt the following questions:
1. What do you learn from the above case study in relation to the concept 
of ethics?
2. From the acts of student Y and Z, whose act do you appreciate or 
depreciate? Why?
Remember
 üEthics enables us to understand and distinguish what 
is moral and immoral or right and wrong, good and 
bad, acceptable and unacceptable.
 üIt is concerned with what is good for individuals and 
society.
 üManaging life and acting responsibly is very hard 
without ethics.
 üEthics teaches us to follow the right way or do the right 
thing.5
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookLESSON  
1.2.   Major ethical values 
As it has been discussed above, ethics deals with those values that impose obligations 
on human beings to do the right thing and refrain from bad or wrong doings. Values 
are specific principles, beliefs, and standards, ideals that one holds as important and 
right. Values are the rules by which one makes decisions about right and wrong. It 
gives us a moral compass or direction. The major ethical values are discussed below 
in detail.⓶⓶
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 ☑Explain the major ethical values
 ☑Advocate attributes of a person who has true integrity
 ☑Demonstrate ethical values expected of good citizens
BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮What are the major ethical values you exhibit in your daily 
life?6
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookFigure 1.1:    Major Ethical Values
 Integrity
Integrity refers to   devotion to moral and ethical principles regarding our decisions 
and actions in our daily life. It also implies the quality of being honest or having 
strong moral principles. Integrity is when our behavior matches our beliefs. It’s 
when what we say and what we do match.  We say an individual has integrity when 
BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮Do you always do the right things? If your answer is ‘Yes’, 
why do you do the right thing? If, ‘No’, why do you fail to do 
the right things? 7
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookhis/her private and public life aligns. People with integrity are generally known to 
be trustworthy, honest, and kind. This is a quality that everyone should strive for. In 
today’s Ethiopia, developing and preserving all necessary moral integrity as citizens 
is not a matter of choice, rather it is the responsibility of all of us. For instance, a person 
who has integrity has different responsibilities such as responsibility to humanity, 
responsibility to him/her self, responsibility to his/her family, responsibility to his/
her society, responsibility to his/her religion and responsibility to his/her country. 
So, integrity is about thinking critically and deciding on your behaviors and actions 
based on the moral values and principles rather than simply attending your personal 
interest.
Case Study
Ms. ‘X’ is a resident of Addis Ababa City. She has a building which is 
rented at a high rate per-month. However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19 
pandemic in Ethiopia in 2019, she donated her building for the treatment 
of peoples infected with the pandemic Ms. ‘X’ says thatt the money she get 
from renting the building is not more than the lives of patients at this difficult 
time to the country and the whole world. She also says that humanity can 
be measured by our kindness to others, not by our self-indulgence to fulfil 
only our personal desires.
Based on the above case study, attempt the following questions:
1. What do you learn from Ms. ‘X’ from the point of integrity?
2. What is the advantage of being a person like Ms. ‘X’ oneself, one’s 
community and one’s country?8
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook Attributes of a person who has true integrity 
Peoples with integrity have important qualities which we all should possess.  Such 
people:
A. Respect humanity:  People with integrity believe that everyone deserves respect 
for the mere reason that he/she is a human being regardless of any considerations 
such as race, ethnicity, language, religion, place of birth, etc.
B. Walk their talk:  Persons with integrity are characterized by suiting their actions 
with their words.  They have the moral courage and determination to do what they 
say. Such people have a good understanding about their moral obligations in the 
community and are committed enough in discharging those obligations. 
C. Are honest:  persons of integrity are characterized by devotion to the facts. Such 
kind of persons do not have unethical behaviors such as lying, stealing, cheating, 
corruption, etc. For example, one of the manifestations of an individual’s integrity 
is honestly paying one’s taxes. Individuals who possess the ethical values of 
integrity are honest to themselves and don’t engage in activities that cheat and harm 
the public for the satisfaction of their self-interest. Citizens should pay their taxes 
by distancing themselves from tax fraud, tax evasion and involving in any illegal 
activities. Citizens high regard for paying their taxes is a sure sign of the degree of 
pride they have towards their country. In Ethiopia the number of people who pay 
their taxes is very small as compared to the wealth generated by the economy. The 
culture of paying taxes is still at a low stage. There widespread practices of tax 
evasion, tax fraud, forgery of documents together with inefficient and bureaucratic 
tax collection administration hamper socio-economic development of the country .
D. Take responsibility for their actions:  Taking responsibility for any action that we 
do in our daily life is a great moral excellence which is expected from us.  Taking 
responsibility is not a loss, rather it is a kind of ladder to success.  
E. Are kind:  people with integrity are benevolent or kind hearted.  They are also 
happy with the change and success of others. Such peoples are free from abnormal 
jealousy that can harm others and also they do not take the advantages of others. 
F. Know well their strengths and weaknesses:  People with integrity appreciates 
their strengths and learn from their shortcomings for further self-improvements. 
G. Are hard workers : persons of integrity believe that a relief from poverty and 
hardships can be achieved only through the culture of working hard.9
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookH. Free from addiction:  Addiction is misuse of substance (alcohol, smoking cigarette, 
chewing khat and drugs) and non-substance (gambling, etc) things that can affect 
one’s health, socio-economic and work performance. So, persons of integrity are 
free from those addictions.
Case Study
Ato Alemu and Ato Bulcha are owners of an infant formula milk importing 
company.  Ato Alemu knowingly has been involving in contraband activities 
by importing infant formula milk products which are out of their expiry 
dates with the assistance of a friend of him working at customs duty offices 
that resulted in the loss of the life of many children. Ato Alemu shares some 
of the money he gets out of selling the products to his friend.  Finally, Ato 
Alemu has been arrested for his illegal business activities and sentenced for 
20 years. On the other hand, Ato Bulcha has been undertaking his business 
with integrity by distancing himself from illegal trade practices. He paid 
his due taxes honestly. He has been tempted to engage in contraband trade 
practices that would result in a huge personal advantage, though he resisted 
by upholding his integrity and public trust.
Attempt the following questions based on the above case study?
1. Evaluate the business practices of Ato Alemu and Ato Bulcha with 
regard to ethical values of citizens?
2. How do you see the practices of the custom’s duty officer? And why 
does he involves in such practices?10
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookHow to enhance your integrity?
You can enhance your integrity in the following ways.
• Make and keep commitments to yourself 
• Stand for something – know your values and stick to them 
• Be open – open your mind, heart and ears
 Promise keeping  
Promise refers to keeping a verbal commitment to do something to someone else. 
Keeping promise demand you to limit or sacrifice your other wants in order to 
fulfill something for other people. Promises are actions that can create love, strong BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮What is a promise?
Activity 1.1
Do the following questions in groups and reflect your discussion 
results to the class.
1. Which traits of a person with true integrity do you possess and 
which ones you don’t?
2. What are the advantages of having qualities of a person with 
true integrity for yourself and your community?
3. Can you mention the effects of loss of integrity on yourself, your 
community or your country?11
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookfriendships and smooth relationships with others. Promise is not something you do 
only for others. One can make promise for himself or herself to improve his/her life. 
For instance, a person who smokes cigarette can promise to himself to stop smoking. 
On the other hand, although we believe that promising something for someone is 
very important, we have to be careful that we should not promise something out of 
our boundary, because, we don’t make promises we can’t keep. 
Case Study
Lemlem is grade 9 student in one of the schools in Ethiopia. Unfortunately, 
she is in a difficult situation to continue her education because there is 
no body to help her financially. One day she told some of her intimate 
classmates that she was going to stop her education due to the problem 
she was experiencing. After hearing this, her classmates felt sorry and 
started discussing how to help her. One of her classmates called Abdi, 
who is from a rich family, took the responsibility of convincing his family 
to help Lemlem so that she could continue her education. As a result, he 
presented Lemlem’s case to his family. Abdi’s family appreciated him for 
his noble idea and immediately decided to help Lemlem. Then, they met 
her in person and promised to help her with all possible means until she 
completes her education. Accordingly, Lemlem completed her education 
successfully without any problem by the help of Abdi’s family.
Based on the above case study, attempt the following questions:
1. What do you learn from the action of Abdi’s family about promise 
keeping?
2. What are the advantages of keeping promise?12
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook Loyalty
Loyalty is the attribute of being truthful/honest to an individual, a society, an 
institution or a country. It refers to the qualities and values of a person who is 
honest.  Loyalty is primarily a matter of conscience, and it is also vital for many 
other matters. Loyalty is needed at work place, between friends, between a husband 
and a wife, between a lender and a debtor. It is a very essential ethical value in the 
socio-economic and political activities of a country. The issue of loyalty is of great 
social and national value. 
Individuals who are in charge of leading the people and the country should be honest 
and trustworthy. Public leaders or administrators should be loyal to their people and 
use the public property under their control in a fair and just manner. They should 
serve everyone equally regardless his/her ethnicity, place of birth, religion, language, 
Activity 1.2
Do the following questions in groups and reflect your discussion 
results to the class.
1. Can you remember something you promised to someone else? 
Did you keep your promise or not?
2. What are the consequences of breaking one’s promises?
BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮Are you faithful to others?13
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbooksex, etc. In the same way, employees or professionals working in a particular 
institution or organization should be loyal to their employer and the societies who 
seek their services.  They should do their jobs according to the rules and regulations 
of their employer without giving priority for cheap private desires and interests. 
For example, professionals such as teachers, medical doctors, accountants, soldiers, 
engineers, etc. should serve their people and their country with loyalty. They should 
not run for their personal benefit or they should not get some special benefit by 
saying “my salary is not enough to live on”. So, as good citizens, we need to be 
faithful in our family, in our neighborhood, community, friendship, school, work 
place, and faithful to the country at large. 
 
Activity 1.3
Do the following questions in groups and reflect your discussion 
results to the class.
1. What are the consequences of the absence of loyalty in the 
family, friendship, relationships and workplace?
2. Go to government institutions nearby your school. Observe 
and ask employees of the institutions about the extent to which 
they are loyal to their institution and the peoples who seek their 
services. Ask them also about the advantages of being loyal. 
Then, reflect to the class what you found out.14
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook      Concern for others 
Concern for others refers to the habits of having a place for, listening to or consider 
the needs and feelings of others. Concern for others means enabling or allowing 
others to participate in the decision making process that can affect them regarding 
the political, economic and social life.  Concern for others is also about supporting 
others in times of difficulty or hardship. As citizens, it is our moral responsibility to 
be concerned for different sections of our societies who seek our support and care 
like peoples with disabilities, children, elders, women and peoples with HIV/AIDS.  
In our society there are good cultures of helping each other in different situations of 
their social life. For example, it is common to help each other in time of wedding 
ceremony, traditional cooperative systems (Debo/Jigi), when someone gets birth, 
mourning, during natural and man-made disasters, when a person is seriously sick, 
when someone is in a difficult economic problems, etc. 
Activity 1.4
Go to your community and identify whether there are concerns 
or special supports or not given to peoples with disabilities, street 
children, elders, women and peoples with HIV/AIDS   by the 
communities, government or NGOs. Then, present your findings 
to the class with the facilitation of your teacher. Your activity 
work shall focus on the following questions:
1. What kinds of concerns or support given to them and what do 
you learn from that?
2. If there is not any concern for these peoples from concerned 
bodies, what kinds of possible solutions do you suggest?15
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook Respect for others 
Respecting is not something new or unfamiliar for us. It is a well-known moral value 
in our families, communities and the school. For instance, we have the culture of 
showing respect to our parents, elders, teachers, friends, neighbors and significant 
others. Respect is having positive feelings toward a person or treating a person with 
dignity regardless of ethnicity, religion, language, color, sex, economic background, 
disability and age (being a child or an adult). Thus, we have to respect each other for 
the mere reason that we are being human not for any other reason.
Figure 1.2:     Giving respect to our parents, elders, teachers, friends and neighbors
We can be respectful to the people, things and places in the following ways.
• Using kind or polite words even when we are upset;
• Using manners like sharing, waiting our turn, saying please and thank you;
• Accepting difference or at least disagreeing with kind words;
• Being careful not to damage places or things;
16
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook• Using a quiet voice or calm behavior in public places;
• Sharing resources, only taking what we really need.
On the other hand, a person who may not respect others may:
• Face exclusion from other people
•  Not get respect from other people
•  Not have love of other people and good friendship
•  Not get support in time of hardship
 Abiding by the law
Abiding by the law refers to our willingness, commitment and responsibility to obey 
or follow the rules and regulations.  Rules are prescribed standards, or guides, for 
our conduct in a society or in an organization, like school. Rules are principles and 
they help us to follow basic values and principles. For instance, we have the duty not 
to steal, not to cheat exams, not to commit corruption, and to respect the well-being 
of fellow citizens in our society. If we violate these rules, we will be punished, face 
condemnations and exclusion from the society. 
Laws and regulations, on the other hand, are written standards of action endorsed 
by authority. They are binding and you will be punished if you break them. For 
example, your school has its own rules and regulations which are considered the 
laws of the school. As a result, wearing school uniform, respecting teachers, being 
punctual, not cheating exams, etc. are some of the standards we need to respect. So, 
if you fail to respect these rules, you will be punished. 
Activity 1.5
Do the following questions in groups and reflect your discussion 
results to the class.
1. Why is being respectful important in our life?
2. What are the impacts of not respecting others?17
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook Commitment to excellence
Commitment refers to one’s dedication to do something, whereas excellence refers 
to continuously building our inner strength and to face challenges. The journey of 
our life is not always smooth and luxurious. Rather it is full of ups and downs or 
hardships. However, our commitment to continuously face challenges or hardships 
that we face in our daily life can make us excellent and resilient citizens.  The path 
that takes us to excellence is not short and easy. It is challenging and painful. Thus, 
commitment to excellence refers to taking full responsibility for our behaviors, 
decisions and actions or endeavors in every single situation in order to do great 
things or being excellent and resilient person in our life.  For example, as a student 
you have to take full responsibility to engage in all of our academic endeavors in 
every single situation and place in order to score wonderful results at the end.

Case Study
Omod   was a student from a very poor family. No one did help him from 
the time he had started his education until he completed it. He was working 
as a shoe-shiner in his time out of school. In addition to this, sometimes he 
served as a daily laborer. He supported himself with the income he earned 
this way and continued his education without support from anyone else. 
Surprisingly, Omod   was a clever student in his education and he always 
ranked 1st from all sections until he completed his education. He never felt 
frustration and hopelessness by the lack of support. .....19
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook.....Case Study
...... Rather, he was happy with all the hardships and he faced them 
continuously with great dedication to accomplish his vision. Finally, 
Omod   scored straight ‘A’ in all subjects in grade 12 national examination. 
As a matter of chance, a scholarship opportunity was announced by the 
Government of Japan in the field of engineering for only two students from 
East African Countries. Omod   won this scholarship after a very tough 
competition. Then, he completed his study in Japan with a great distinction. 
He was a gold medalist of the year in engineering. Finally, Omod   studied 
his MSC and PhD degrees in Germany. Now he is among the well-known 
engineers in Ethiopia and is making significant contributions in different 
mega projects being run by the government.
Do the questions based on the case study presented above as 
homework. Present your answer for one of the questions to the class. 
You will be given a maximum of two minutes.
1. What do you learn from the story of  Omod  ?
2. How do   you compare yourself with Omod  ?

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook1.4.1.     The meaning of applied ethics
Applied ethics is the art or science of reflecting on moral dilemmas and moral 
problems in different social contexts. Applied ethics is a growing, interdisciplinary 
field dealing with ethical problems in different areas of society. It includes for instance 
social and political ethics, computer ethics, medical ethics, bioethics, environmental 
ethics, business ethics, and it also relates to different forms of professional ethics. 
From the perspective of ethics, applied ethics is a specialization in one area of ethics. 
From the perspective of social practice applying ethics is to focus on ethical aspects 
and implications of that particular practice.
1.4.2. Professional ethics
Profession is defined as any occupation/job/vocation that requires advanced expertise 
(skills and knowledge), self-regulation, and concerned service to the public good. It 
brings a high status, socially and economically. The characteristics of a profession 
are: an occupation whose core element is work based upon the mastery of a complex 
body of knowledge and skills. It is a vocation in which knowledge of some department 
of science or learning or the practice of an art founded upon it is used in the service 
of others. Its members are governed by codes of ethics and profess a commitment to 
competence, integrity and morality, altruism, and the promotion of the public good 
within their domain. These commitments form the basis of a social contract between 
a profession and society, which in return grants the profession a monopoly over the 
use of its knowledge base, the right     to considerable autonomy in practice and the 
privilege of self-regulation. Professions and their members are accountable to those 
served and to society.BrainstormingBrainstorming

26
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookProfessional ethics is about the moral obligations, rules and principles that 
professionals should employ to achieve the main objective of their profession. For 
example, one of the professional ethics of teaching profession implies teacher’s 
smooth relationships with their students, colleagues, employers and students’ parents 
who are relevant stake holders in the professional life of teachers. These principles 
guide teachers in their daily activities while working with their stake holders.
Professional ethics includes the important attributes such as honesty, integrity, 
transparency, confidentiality, impartiality, punctuality, respectfulness and obedience 
to the law.
 
 Environmental ethics
Environment is the surrounding natural world which contains both living and 
nonliving things such as land, animals, plants, water, air, etc. Environment is the 
foundation and the source of the survival of all living things. It can be understood 
as the overall economic, social and cultural conditions that influence the life of an 
individual or community.
Currently our world is found under a serious threat of climate change and 
environmental degradation. This problem is changing from worse to the worst level 
from time to time. So, giving a great focus to the well-being of the environment is 
not a matter of choice, rather it is a matter of survival. This is because, our life fully 
depends on the environment and the earth’s resources that are finite. Thus, all of us

environment for the sake our survival.
Environmental ethics refers to the moral obligations expected from human beings 
to protect and maintain the well-being of their environment. Environmental ethics 
is the discipline that studies about the established values, principles and set of 
beliefs between human beings and the surrounding environment. There is a direct 
relationship between the life of human beings and the environment. This means that 
when the environment is safe and healthy, we are leading good and healthy life. 
When the environment is damaged, our life is also directly affected.

2.1.     The concept of digital technology
What is meant by “digital technology”? Digital technology refers to the use of 
computers, tablets,  mobile phones and digital and social media that are accessed 
on those devices through internet. The concept of digital technology may also 
involve new communication technologies that could have significant effects on the 
political, economic, social and cultural life of the societies. Digital technology plays 
significant roles in transferring information and data quickly from one section of the 
world to another and among individuals as well. This can be taken place through the 
use of mobile application, social media platforms and digital marketing websites.

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookon different types of technologies. Technology touches every aspect our of life, 
making it easier, better and life changing. For instance, due to digital technology 
application through available social network and social media platform there is 
high interconnection between individuals and global societies. Many peoples use 
electronic devices such as computers and mobile phones and internet in their daily 
life.
As discussed above, the use of digital technology in all life aspects of human 
activities is becoming a normal job and a culture now a days.
Digital technology was started in the mid-20th century and now it has become 
the most significant modern technology not only in developed countries but also 
in developing countries including Ethiopia. The use and application of digital 
technology is crucially important in our day to day life, especially for communication 
speed, learning opportunities, social relation and money exchange in the finance 
sector.
Figure 2.1:    Some of Modern Digital Technologies
In the contemporary Ethiopia easy and fast communications among individuals, 
money transfer, banking and access to education are impossible without digital 
technology. As digital citizens, our individual life is highly dependent on modern 
digital media technologies in our daily life. This may involve the use of mobile 
phone for communication with our family members, online service through internet, 
35
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookmoney transfer through mobile banking at any time. These technologies are making 
our life easier and better by saving our time and physical contact to get different 
kinds of services.
Activity 2.1
Currently, there are students and teachers who are using different 
electronic devices and social media networks for various purposes 
in your school even if not all. Accordingly, be in group of five 
students  and ask at least four  students and two teachers who 
are using electronic devices and social medias  the following 
listed questions. Then, present what you find to the class:
1. Do you have a mobile phone, laptop computer or tablets?

2.2.     Culture and digital technology
Culture and technology is the major factors that can shape our world outlooks. They 
are two equal forces that greatly influence our attitudes, beliefs, behaviors and our 
understanding of good and bad in different ways. Society’s cultures are the bases 
of human civilization and technological advancement. This implies that cultural 
values of the society and modern technologies are very interdependent. When new 
technologies are introduced into a society, the culture reacts in either positive or 
negative way. 
Cultural development and digital technologies are directly interlinked in terms of 
making accessible one’s cultures to others. The essential way to live in societies ⓶⓶

 ☑Describe the relationship between culture and digital 
technology
 ☑Examine the effects of digital technology on society’s 
cultures37
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookand to maintain one’s culture is to communicate through which cultural elements 
are shared. Communication technologies used to share ideas and feelings through 
which culture is learned, transmitted and preserved. This enables us to promote our 
own cultural values and also to know the cultures of other societies.  Therefore, 
it is difficult to promote and preserve one’s own culture  effectively without 
communication media in this digital world.
Digital technologies are very crucial in highlighting the bright aspects of our country 
to the rest of the world. Ethiopia is a country of multicultural societies where different 
nations and nationalities have been living together for a long period of time. Thus, 
all nations and nationalities need to promote and preserve their cultures through 
different means. Accordingly, in this digital age it is very important to use different 
digital communication technologies such as you tube, face book, twitter, telegram, 
imo, etc to promote one’s own cultures in responsible and ethical way. For instance, 
we can promote the untold facts of our culture such as language, way of life, cultural 
dressing, cultural food, arts, historical tourism sites, holiday celebrities, etc to other 
societies and across the world through social media platforms.
However, digital technologies have not only positive impacts on one’s own culture. 
It has serious negative impacts against one’s own culture if they are not used 
appropriately and in responsible manner. Accordingly, using such technologies in a 
way deviated from our norms or moral values and principles can lead to the cultural 
diffusion and destruction of  indigenous values and norms of a particular society. For 
example, as you can understand from figure 2.2.  Below, inappropriate use of digital 
technology can affect family relationships. Both husband and wife are too busy in 
using their social media on their food and by ignoring their child.
Thus, our digital culture must be in line with the existing moral, social, and cultural 
values of the society in contemporary digital age.38

effects of digital media on the cultures of your community
Remember
 üCultural values of the society and modern technologies are 
very interdependent to each other’s. Digital technologies may 
have its own advantages and disadvantages on our culture.
 üTherefore, use and application of digital technology and 
media in day-to-day life must be line with the existing moral, 
social and cultural values of the society in digital age.

Now-a-days, digital technologies are part of our daily life activities. Many of us are 
using digital technology like laptops, tablets, mobile phones and internet to easily, 
quickly and cost effectively get different services. Using the digital technology for 
the right purpose helps us to undertake our work more efficiently and effectively.

century40
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook1) Social connection
Information is the indispensable factors in all aspects of our life. Connecting 
families, relatives and members of the societies at all levels is very crucial for healthy 
social life. To make our social life better communication is not only in a formal 
ways but also in informal ways. This involves sharing of ideas and information 
with each other’s through different social media and digital technology application. 
Digital technology has simplified the process of socialization by enabling people 
to communicate with families, friends and team-workers when working remotely. 
This has made it possible to communicate via words, video (video calls, virtual 
conferences) and exchange media. Without the use of digital devices and information 
communication technology, leading life is becoming very difficult these days.
Figure 2.3:    Video chatting.
2) Communication speed
Digital technology helps a large amount of information to be compressed on 
small storage devices that can be transported. The speed of internet is constantly 
improving, thereby, enabling us to transfer tons of information instantly and access 
data virtually anywhere in the world. It also improves the speed of transmission and 
ultimately transformed the way that people communicate, work and learn. Thus, 
41
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookcommunication through digital technology enables the global communities conduct 
speedy communication and information exchange in fraction of micro seconds 
and this to makes life on this earth better. As a result of this, in the age of digital 
technology fastest and speedy exchange of information and massages via internet 
based social networks are playing a major role in this respect. For instance, without 
the use of Email communication between senders and receivers it is very difficult for 
individuals and organizations.
3) Online learning opportunities
The daily use of all forms of digital media is part of our lives and therefore becomes 
a key component of education. In modern society, people use digital media daily and 
seamlessly, and educators need to consider the integration of digital media today 
and for the future. By having access to the internet, nowadays we can all access 
different information within seconds just by searching online. Digital technology has 
made it possible for everyone to have access to things like online courses, training, 
books, journals, publications and other important information. The facilities of 
online education and the availability of interactive media have made the process of 
learning so interesting. Therefore, using digital technology and digital media helps 
to get access to education through online learning without going to learning center 
using these digital technologies.
4) Digital marketing
Digital marketing is also another essential purpose of using digital media in business 
activities. Digital marketing is the promotion of your business using online resources 
and tools. Tools used in digital marketing include websites, micro-sites, mobile 
application and social media platforms. Using online selling, businesses allow 
customers to buy whenever they want, even when your shop doors are closed. Selling 
online typically helps reduce processing times internally, enabling you to focus staff 
elsewhere in the business. This is used to give customers access to your business 
through whatever means they prefer – a mobile device, desktop computer, phone 
call or social media to find the information, service or product they are looking for .

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookUsing the right digital technology for the right purpose efficiently and effectively 
is the burning issues in the current digital world. Using digital media in our day-
to-day life must be governed by set of ethical codes of conduct. This involves the 
objective of using digital media and proper identification of their advantages and

2.5.     Effective communication through digital media
Communication is one of the most important ways to transfer and exchange 
messages and information in our relation with others. It is the art and technique 
of informing, and influencing, individuals, and the large audience about important 
issues in scientific and ethical methods. Effectiveness of communication determines 
the success and failure for individual and collective goal achievement. Digital 
media becomes the key strategy for effective communication. Today, organizations 
and individuals has some type of online or digital presence through, social media 
accounts, online networks and databases and emails to communicate with the public. 
There are various digital technologies which make use of the fastest growing 
information communication technology that we use to make communication effective ⓹⓹

communication47
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookThis has improved businesses and personal communication. Successful modern 
organizations also use digital media to their advantage and to achieve effective 
communication  The contribution of digital media to effective communication has 
improved because:
• Cellular technology and satellite communication have increased 
communication speeds and made ‘connection’ easier. 
• Internet has enabled easy exchange of information over long distances and 
accessing a web page server in some far-off country. 
• Computers have enabled better storage and presentation of information,  and 
have made the process of teaching easier and more effective.
• Mobile phones have enabled e-commerce by giving customers the option 
to transact via their Mobile phones or Tablets and to perform specific tasks.
2.5.1       Challenges of using digital media
The world we live in today is surrounded by digital media products which enable 
and deliver experiences in all sorts of human activities. This involves the use 
and application of digital technology as indispensable tools that give users quick 
electronic communication. However, using these digital technologies and social 
media platform is becoming challenging. Many of these challenges are related 
to social media because social media is an internet-based platform. Social media 
like Facebook have many drawbacks such as decreasing academic performance, 
negatively affecting performance in the workplace, and causing problems in personal 
relationships. BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮What are the disadvantages of using digital technology and 
social media in present world?48
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookUltimately, our current civilization could not exist without technology and digital 
technology is a vital force necessary to our existence, as it help us to live in a better 
world. In today’s digital world there’s no doubt that use and application of digital 
technology and social media networks has become integral in our daily lives, for 
better. However, this digital technology and social media platforms may not only 
used for better or good by individuals and groups in different parts of the world. 
Therefore,  users should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of digital 
technology or social media networks to use the current digital media and social media 
platforms more safely so as to minimize the risks while using these technologies. 
Thus, the main challenges that are involved in using this internet-based platform 
include:
1. Disregard for Ethical Values:  Social media is a platform for connecting 
people and allowing them to network, share news and air their personal 
opinions. However, maintaining ethics in uploading content in social media is 
also a challenging issue because social media allow users to upload any content. 
Thus, ensuring ethics in an individual level is a great challenge today. Ethics in 
digital media involves the moral problem that is associated with the adoption of 
new communication technologies in daily activities. The major concern in the 
ethics of digital media is the effect of information that is transmitted through 
these channels. The big challenge is that, the accuracy of the information is not 
controlled, and at times it can cause various impacts to the society. Therefore, 
to use social media effectively in our day-to-day life we have to use digital 
technology ethically in appropriate manner.
2. Fabrication of Fake News:  Fake news refers to false reports or 
misinformation shared in the form of articles, images, or videos which are seems 
as “real news” and aim to manipulate people’s opinions. In times of digital 
information exchange, fake news has become more of an online phenomenon 
that is difficult to control and sharing of fabricated news to shape public opinion 
becomes common phenomenon. Fake news can reach high levels of visibility in 
a short amount of time because it’s easy to share via social media. They involves 
reports, images, and videos that are shared to purposefully spread misinformation 
i.e. information that is factually incorrect. It can be created by individuals or 
groups who are acting in their own interests or those of third parties. Fake news 
is mostly used to manipulate public opinion for political or commercial gain 49
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookto attract people to click through to linked websites and generate advertising 
income. Therefore, fake news and misinformation is common problem through 
all social media platforms. 
3. Personal Privacy and Security Issues: The most challenging aspects of 
using social media is privacy and security issues about which, users very much 
worried. It is very difficult to maintain privacy in social media since they are public 
platforms anyone can easily access the personal information of others. As a result 
of this, protecting individual privacy and keeping information confidentially is 
at risk in the age of digital technologies. For example, when individual posted 
and uploaded about his/her private life on Facebook and YouTube someone 
could share it for public so that anyone can see it. In present day, the security 
issues becomes challenges to the state national security. In general, social media 
platforms, which collect and store huge personal information with limited 
governmental oversight, serve as attractive targets for bad actors seeking to use 
that data to perpetrate fraud and theft.
4. Cyber Bullying:  Cyber bullying occurs when a bully uses email, websites, or 
text messaging to harass other people. It can be done directly to an individual by 
sending them insults or threats via email, instant messaging, or text messaging. It 
also includes sharing personal or private information about someone that causes 
embarrassment or humiliation. Sometimes, cyber bullying can be a criminal act, 
under the criminal code. For example, making a repeated to others and making 
them fear for their safety and the safety of those around them.
5. Computer Hacking: the most common challenge for users of social media 
is computer hacking. It refers to actions practiced by individuals, organizations, 
and nations, in order to gain unauthorized access to computer and technology 
dependent systems. Hacking is a kind of criminal offense. Hacker access users’ 
account and cease all kind of personal information of those users. These activities 
may involve the modification or alteration of system’s software and hardware in 
order to perform activities neither purposed by the creator nor in line with the 
creator’s original intentions.50

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookUnit Summary
The use and application of digital technology is critically important in our day to 
day life especially in terms of communication speed, learning opportunities, social 
relationships and money exchange in the finance sectors.  Technology and culture 
are two equal forces that greatly influence one another. When a new technology 
is introduced into a society, the culture reacts in both positive and negative ways. 
Digital technologies may have their own advantages and disadvantages on cultures. 
Our digital culture must align with the existing moral, social, and cultural values 
of a society. Nowadays, digital technologies and digital applications are greatly 
influencing and shaping the contemporary society, threatening culture and cultural 
values. Due to the application of digital societies’ cultures, norms and values are 
highly affected.
Thus, using the right digital technology for the right purpose efficiently and 
effectively is the burning issues in the current digital world. Using digital media 
ethically and examining our digital culture in the day to day life and manage this 
challenge are the agenda of discussion at national and international levels. Using 
digital media in our day-to-day life must be governed by a set of ethical codes of 
conduct since our rules of conduct for proper way of using these technologies have 
direct effect on our behavior. 
Therefore, for the effective utilization digital media we have to identify their benefits 
and potential challenges before using the currently available social media and other 
digital technologies.

ideas on the concept of constitution?By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 ☑Define constitution
 ☑List types of constitution
 ☑Identify the advantages and disadvantages of written and 
unwritten constitutions
 ☑Describe constitutional principles56
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookAs you may remember, constitution is a fundamental document that contains the 
basic laws of a country. It is the most fundamental or supreme law of a state that 
underlines the existence of the state. Constitution is the aggregate of laws, customs, 
conventions, principles, rules and regulations by which a particular government of 
a country implements its administrative activities. It is a fundamental document that 
defines the nature of government and its functions, the rights and duties of citizens.  
The vast majority of contemporary constitutions describe the basic principles of 
the state, the structures and processes of government and the fundamental rights of 
citizens in a higher law that cannot be unilaterally changed by an ordinary legislative 
act. The content and nature of a particular constitution, as well as how it relates to the 
rest of legal and political order, varies considerably between countries, and there is 
no universal and uncontested definition of a constitution. Nevertheless, any broadly 
accepted working definition of a constitution would likely include the following 
characteristics:
A constitution is a set of fundamental legal-political rules that:
• Are binding on everyone in the state, including ordinary lawmaking institutions;
• Concern the structure and operation of the institutions of government, political 
principles and the rights of citizens;
• Are based on widespread public legitimacy;
• Are harder to change than ordinary laws (e.g. a two-thirds majority vote or a 
referendum is needed);
• As a minimum, meet the internationally recognized criteria for a democratic 
system in terms of representation and human rights.
      Types of constitution 
BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮There are different types or classifications of constitution. 
Can you mention some of them?57
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookA.     Written and Unwritten Constitution
* Written constitution: 
written constitutions are constitutions that exist in a single document or in a codified 
form. A written constitution refers to a collection of documents in which the 
fundamental rules regarding the nature of the government and the rights and duties 
of citizens are clearly laid down. It is precise, definite and systematic. It is the result 
of the conscious and deliberate efforts of the people. It usually is documented and 
framed by a representative body duly enacted by the people at a particular period 
in history. A written constitution is adopted on a specific date in history which is 
supposed to reflect in the preamble to the constitution. The majority of states have 
written constitutions, for example, the 1995 Constitution of the FDRE, American 
constitution, Indian constitution, etc.   
Advantages of written constitution
Written constitution has different advantages. It is easily accessible to citizens. 
Citizens can get written constitutions in different ways, for instance, from the library, 
from other individuals, from online, or buy from bookshops. Written constitution 
also enables citizens to easily learn about their rights and duties. One of the main 
purposes of the constitution is to define the rights and duties of citizens. So, in the 
case of written constitution citizens can have the chance to refer the rights guaranteed 
to them by the constitution. 
Disadvantages of written constitution
Written constitutions have limitations mainly in terms of its rigidity. Compared 
to the unwritten constitution, it is not as such easy to improves in the changing 
circumstances. 
* Unwritten constitution: 
unwritten constitution is a constitution that is not found in a single written document. 
Instead, it exists in terms of customs and conventions. It is unsystematic, indefinite, 
and imprecise. Such a constitution is not the result of conscious and deliberate 
efforts of the people. It is generally the result of a historic development. It is never 
made by a representative constituent assembly at a definite stage of history, nor is 
it promulgated on a particular date. It is, therefore, sometimes called an evolved or 58
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookcumulative constitution. Few countries have unwritten constitution, for instance, the 
Constitution of Britain. 
Advantages of unwritten constitution
Unwritten constitution has also its own advantages. For instance, it is simple or 
easy to make amendments or changing some constitutional provisions. Since it is 
undocumented or uncodified constitution, it is suitable for improving or amendment.
Disadvantages of unwritten constitution
Unwritten constitution is not easily accessible to citizens. Citizens can also have not 
the chance to easily learn about their rights and duties from constitutional document 
unlike the case with the  written constitution. 
B.     Rigid and Flexible Constitutions
Based on the amendment procedure or changing situation, constitution can be 
classified as rigid or flexible. Amendment procedures refers to the modifications 
of the constitution or it is about adding some important issues to the constitution or 
removing unimportant ones.    Thus, rigid constitution requires special or difficult 
procedures for the amendment process, for example, the constitutions of Ethiopia 
and USA. Rigid constitution cannot be amended, in a manner in which ordinary 
laws are passed amended or repealed. On the other hand, flexible constitution is a 
constitution which is simple for amendment. A flexible constitution is one which 
can easily be amended by perhaps an ordinary legislative process or by the ordinary 
resolution. Both constitutional laws and an ordinary law are treated alike since all 
constitutional amendments can be made by a simple majority of the legislature.
Activity 3.1
One of the advantages of written constitution is that it enables citizens 
to easily learn about their rights and duties. Thus, find the 1995 FDRE 
constitution and read chapter three of the constitution which talks 
about human rights. Then, tell the class some of the rights of citizens 
stated in the constitution with their reciprocal duties.59
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookIt doesn’t require special procedure for amendment, for example, the Constitutions 
of Britain and Israel.
C.     Federal and Unitary Constitutions
A federal constitution is one which distributes power between the federal and regional 
governments, for example, the 1995 FDRE constitution. It distributes powers to 
the federal and the regional governments. On the other hand, a constitution that 
centralizes all state power at the central government is called unitary constitution. 
for example, the Constitution of Britain.
      Constitutional Principles
Constitution consists of certain fundamental principles in the form of constitutional 
principles.   Constitution can be realized as per the important principles stated in it. 
I.  Popular Sovereignty:  refers to the ultimate or supreme power of the people. 
The people are the ultimate source of power. The government must be based 
on the consent of the people. 
II. Limited government:  the power of government must be limited by the 
constitution. This means that it should act according to the power and 
functions given to it by the constitution. 
III. Separation of powers:  constitution assigns specific responsibilities and 
powers to each branch of the government such as legislative, executive and 
judiciary organs for the purpose of check and balance system.
IV . Rule of law:  refers to every one acts according to the rule of law. The law 
applies to everyone, even to those who are on power. 
V. Respect for human rights:  the human rights of individuals or groups must 
be respected by both government and ordinary citizens.
VI. Transparency and accountability:  Transparency refers to the condition 
of making the conducts and actions of government officials shall be open 
or transparent to the public, whereas accountability refers to the condition 
in which  government officials are held responsible for any failure in their 
official duties.60

Activity 3.2
1. Discuss in groups the importance of incorporating these basic 
principles in the constitution or supreme law of the land.61
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookRemember
 üConstitution is the highest and fundamental law of a 
state. It is the mother of all laws.
 üConstitution is very important to ensure rule of law and 
to put the government within its limit.
 üThe constitution of a country can be in written or 
unwritten forms. However, citizens of a country that has 
a written constitution have better access to information 
about their rights and duties.
 üIn democratic countries, the constitution is the 
embodiment of the will of the people.
 üTypes of constitution consists of written and unwritten 
constitution, rigid and flexible constitution, federal and 
unitary constitution. 
 üConstitution can be realized as per the important 
principles stated in it such as popular sovereignty, 
limited government, separation of powers, rule of 
law,  respect for human rights and  transparency and 
accountability.62

Figure 3.2:    A leader accountable to the

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookConstitutionalism refers to a government system that is based on and acts according 
to the supreme law.  Constitutionalism implies a limited system of government 
by law in which there is actual or real realizations of the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of citizens, a real practice of good governance, rule of law and separations 
of powers. In particular, these limitations of power directly concern the three branches 
of government: the legislative, executive and judiciary organs.  A constitution  is  the  
legal  and  moral  framework  setting  out  these  powers  and  their limitations. This 
framework must represent the will of the people, and should therefore be arrived at 
through consensus.
According to the notion of constitutionalism, the behavior and actions of the 
government as well as its agents should be founded on the fundamental principles 
of the constitution.
      Importance of Constitutionalism
A real practice of constitutionalism in a given country has a very remarkable 
contribution and is usually at the forefront in insuring peace and stability and human 
well-being. Some of the major contributions of constitutionalism are discussed as 
follows:
Realizations of human rights of citizens:  Human rights are inviolable and

1. Do you think that the existence of constitution alone implies the 
existence of constitutionalism?
2. Discuss the characteristics of a limited form of government vis-à-

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookinalienable rights. Constitutionalism prevents tyranny and guarantees the liberty 
and rights of individuals or groups of individuals. Respecting human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all is the responsibility of every citizen and the government 
in particular. This can become real only when there is a government which acts 
according to the supreme law. 
Controlling the abuse and misuse of powers of government:  constitutionalism 
checks whether the acts of a government are legitimate, and whether officials conduct 
their public duties in accordance with laws. It provides institutional safeguards 
against abuse and misuse of powers by authorities. Check and balance systems 
are put in place in order to ensure the government acts within their powers. The 
government itself should not be destructive of the values it was intended to promote.
Prevalence of rule of law: Constitutionalism is a foundation for rule of law. 
Constitutionalism proclaims the necessity of the rule of law in contrast to rule by the 
arbitrary judgment. Everyone must be law abiding citizen. Citizens must accept the 
limits on their freedom, and officials must  also observe the limits on their power .

 ☑Describe the constitutional experiences of Ethiopia under 
different regimes.
 ☑Differentiate the similarities and differences between the 
different constitutions.  
 ☑Identify the fundamental constitutional principles under 
the 1995 FDRE constitution67
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookEthiopia is a country that has a long history of constitutional experiences. It used 
traditional or unwritten constitutions until the introduction of the first written 
constitution by Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1931.
3.3.1.     Traditional constitutional experiences of Ethiopia
Prior to 1931, Ethiopia did not have a compiled written constitution. Until the 
early 1930s, the rule of the Ethiopian Emperors was based on traditional and 
customary political and legal premises. The traditional constitutional experience 
was characterized by the dominance of myths and legends that were used to provide 
legitimacy to the monarchs rather than ensuring the basic rights and freedoms of 
citizens. The Kibre Negest (Glory of kings), which is a traditional constitutional 
document in Ethiopia, for example, justifies that the Ethiopian monarchs derived 
their power to rule from God and therefore they are not accountable to any secular 
power. The other traditional document is Fetha Negest (Law of Kings) which justifies 
the authority of kings and their officials. According to Fetha Negest, challenging the 
authority of the king is considered as challenging or rebelling against one’s creator 
- God. Sirate Mengist is the other important document that emerged in the 19thc that 
proved to be administratives and protocol directive of the government. In general, 
during this time there was no opportunity for the Ethiopian people to participate in 
political affairs and to influence the decision making processes of their government. 
The people were merely considered to be subject of the king. The fundamental rights 
and freedoms of individuals and peoples were totally ignored in every government 
activities. 
3.3.2.     Written constitutional experiences in Ethiopia
i.     The 1931 written constitution 
In Ethiopia the first written constitution was introduced in 1931. On July 16 1931 
a few months after his coronation, Emperor Haile Silassie I granted to the people 
of Ethiopia the first written constitution in the history of Ethiopia. The Emperor 
was motivated to introduce his first written constitution mainly for two reasons. 
The first one was the Emperor’s high aspiration to show Ethiopia as a modern or 
civilized state to the external world. The second reason was, to consolidate emperor’s 
absolute power over local nobilities through a formal constitutional framework. This 68
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookconstitution has 7 chapters and 55 articles.  
What makes the 1931 written constitution to be different from those traditional 
constitutions is the fact that it was a written or codified one. The 1931 written 
constitution did not recognize the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. 
Thus, the principal aim of the constitution was to consolidate the power of the king, 
not to lay foundations for the fundamental rights and dignity of citizens.
ii.     The Revised Constitution of 1955
Twenty years later after the adoption of the first constitution, the imperial regime 
revised its constitution in 1955 mainly for two reasons: internal and external. The 
internal reason was the Italian aggression of Ethiopia in 1935. Accordingly, the 1931 
constitution was interrupted, and the Emperor was also forced to flee to Britain. The 
second and the most basic reason was external one, which was the federation of 
Eritrea with Ethiopia in 1952. The 1955 revised constitution has 8 chapters and 131 
articles.
This constitution come up with some progressive provisions such as democracy 
and human rights, giving recognition for the rights and duties of citizens. The new 
provisions introduced by the revised constitution remained paper-tiger. That means 
they were not mostly practical. The power of the Emperor and the prominent officials 
was not limited. The democratic and human rights of citizens were not guaranteed. 
Rather, this constitution is similar with the 1931 constitution in consolidating the 
absolute power of the emperor. 
Activity 3.5
Evaluate the traditional constitutions and the written imperial 
constitutions discussed above in light of the basic idea of 
constitutionalism? Discuss this question in groups and present 
the results to the class.69
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookiii.     The 1987 Constitution of the People’s Democratic 
Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) 
In 1974, the feudal monarchy or the Imperial Regime was removed from power 
by the Derg military regime. The Derg regime introduced different decrees and 
proclamations which had not constitutional status until the adoption of the 1987 
constitution. Thus, the period from 1974 up to 1987 was known as constitutional 
vacuum or lacuna in Ethiopian political history. The Derg brought about profound 
changes within Ethiopian society. The introduction of socialism as the guiding 
ideology of the military regime brought totally new direction economically, socially, 
politically, psychologically, etc.
In 1987 the government promulgated its own constitution. This constitution has 7 
chapters and 119 articles. Unlike its predecessors, this constitution highlights the 
sovereignty of the constitution, stating that the constitution is the supreme law of the 
country and the base for establishing and administering the country. The constitution 
changed the system of government from the monarchy system to a republican form 
of government. The 1987 PDRE constitution also introduced the idea of secularism 
or the separation of state and religion for the first time in Ethiopia. During the 
imperial regime there was no separation of state and religion
or secular system of government.  
The constitution testifies that the state is strictly unitary type where there is high 
centralization of power in the hands of executive dominated by the president of the 
state (Colonel Mengistu Hailemariam). This unitary socialist state by constitution 
gave a very little concern for human rights and federalism.
Similar to its predecessors, this constitution had not legacy of democratic 
constitutional order. It totally denied the basic rights and freedoms of citizens. 
Finally, after staying on power for 17 years, the Derg regime led by Colonel Mengistu 
Hailemariam was overthrown by the Ethiopian people’s Revolutionary Democratic 
Front (EPDRF) in May 1991. 70
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookiv. The Transitional  Charter of the 1991
The 1991 Transitional Charter was introduced in May 1991 by EPRDF after the 
demise of the Derg regime. The charter served as law of the land for the transitional 
period from 1991 up to 1995. It is a very short document that addressed only some 
fundamental issues. It contains only 20 articles. The charter recognized freedom, 
equal right and self-determination of all nationalities. It also puts high premium on 
human rights.
v. The 1995 Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopian 
(FDRE) Constitution
The period of Transitional Charter was culminated by the adoption of FDRE 
constitution in December 1995. The 1995 FDRE constitution introduced different 
changes as compared to its predecessors. It introduced a federal state structure for 
the first time, parliamentary democracy, and the establishment of the two houses 
of parliament: House of Federation and House of People Representatives. It also 
guarantees the rights and freedoms of citizens as well as describes the duties of the 
citizens.
The 1995 constitution has a preamble and 11 chapters with 106 articles. The 
constitution established the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia with nine 
member states or National Regional governments. However, the total number of 
regional states increased to 11 due to the formation of two new regional states, 
Sidama Regional State in June, 2020 and South-West Ethiopia Region in November 
2021. Governments of the member states have the power to exercise legislative, 
executive and judicial powers in their own rights.
The fundamental Constitutional Principles of the 1995 FDRE 
Constitution
The 1995 FDRE constitution has the following fundamental constitutional principles. 
These are:
A.  Popular sovereignty (Article 8)
B.  Supremacy of the Constitution (Article 9)71
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookC. Respecting Human and Democratic Rights (Article 10) 
D.  Secularism or separation of state and religion (Article 11)
E.  Transparency and Accountability of Government (Article-12)
Activity 3.6
1. Find the 1995 FDRE constitution and read in detail those 
fundamental constitutional principles mentioned above. 
Then, reflect what you understand about those fundamental 
constitutional principles to the class.
2. Compare and contrast  the similarities and differences between 
the constitutions (1931-1995) in terms of limiting the power of 
the government and realizing the rights of citizens?

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookUnit Summary
In this unit you have learned about the notion of constitution and constitutionalism. 
Constitution is the supreme law of the land. It is classified as written and unwritten, 
rigid and flexible, unitary and federal constitution. Constitution also consists of 
fundamental constitutional principles such as popular sovereignty, rule of law, 
respecting human rights, separation of power, limited government, and transparency 
and accountability. On the other hand, constitutionalism refers to the limitation of 
government power by supreme law. Constitutionalism is beyond having a constitution. 
It is against the arbitrary or undemocratic system of government. Constitutionalism 
is all about the real implementation of those fundamental constitutional principles.
You have also learned Ethiopian constitutional experiences. Ethiopia has a long history 
of using different constitutions starting from pre-1931 traditional constitutions up to 
the 1995 FDRE constitution. Although the country has a long time constitutional 
experiences, it does not have  good history and culture of constitutionalism.

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookIntroduction 
In this unit, you are going to learn about 
indigenous knowledge’s. Indigenous 
knowledge is      the understanding, skills 
or wisdoms built up by a particular society 
through its long history of interactions 
with its natural environment. Indigenous 
knowledge’s have significant contributions 
in enhancing local knowledge. This unit 
has three lessons. The first lesson discusses 
the concepts of indigenous knowledge. 
The second lesson deals with the roles 
of indigenous knowledge’s in producing 
responsible citizens. In the last lesson 
you will learn about roles of indigenous 
social institutions in solving problems of 
communities.

 偮Have you ever seen local elders in your community when 
they resolve conflicts that occur between individuals?
 偮Have you ever seen when sick persons or domestic animals 
are treated with folk medicine?
 偮Can you tell the class  some proverbs people in your 
community use to promote resolving conflicts, cooperation

 ☑Define indigenous knowledge
 ☑List different types of indigenous knowledge’s practiced in 
your Communities
 ☑Describe the practices of indigenous knowledge in your 
community78
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookIndigenous knowledge is a knowledge that has been developed by a local people as 
a result of long histories of their social life and interaction with their environment. 
Indigenous knowledge is a knowledge which is based on the culture, traditions, 
social interactions, and ritual, values and beliefs systems of particular community 
or society. This indicates that indigenous knowledges are not the same from society 
to society. 
 Figure 4.1:    Artisan women engaged in pottery making
Ethiopia is a country with rich indigenous knowledge systems in areas such as 
architecture, pottery, medicine, agriculture, cottage industry, conflict resolution and 
environmental conservations. For instance, most of the time when a husband and a 
wife get into conflict, they do not take their case immediately to a court. Rather, they 
take their case to the local elders to resolve their disagreement through a win-win 
approach. This is a popular indigenous conflict resolution mechanism in most parts 
of Ethiopia.
Activity 4.1
1. Go to your community and identify which kinds of indigenous 
knowledge have been practiced from those listed above and 
others. Then, discuss the practices of these indigenous knowledge 
in your community in groups containing four students each.79

LESSON  
4.2.     The role of indigenous knowledge in producing 
responsible citizens⓶⓶
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 ☑Describe the roles of indigenous knowledge in producing 
responsible citizens
 ☑Explain the roles of indigenous knowledge in creating 
responsible citizens for peace building 
 ☑Demonstrate the roles of indigenous knowledge practiced 
in your community80
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookResponsible citizen is a person who has the knowledge and commitment regarding 
his/her contributions for the betterment of his/her livelihood, the community and 
the country. Responsible citizens have vital roles as change agents in ensuring 
sustainable peace and the socio-economic transformations in their community and 
their country. 
Indigenous knowledges have significant contributions in producing responsible 
citizens who can contribute a lot for peace, socio-economic development, health, 
agriculture, arts and environmental conservations. 
Indigenous peace  building  and conflict resolution 
mechanisms
Indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms can play a great role in ensuring 
sustainable peace in a given community using peaceful resolution to conflicts with 
a very low cost. In every community this culture of resolving conflicts has been 
widely practiced. To call some of them as examples, Jaarsummaa of the  Oromo, 
Shimglina and Erq of the  Amhara , Yejoka of the  Gurage, Mada’a and Mablo of the  
Afar , Gedana of the  Sidama, Guurt system of the Somali,etc.
The absence of peace in any community disturbs the whole life and wellbeing 
of both an individual person and community. In Ethiopia, indigenous conflict 
resolution mechanisms have paramount significances than modern conflict 
resolution institutions (e.g. court) in ensuring sustainable peace. In indigenous 
conflict resolution mechanisms elders take the lion shares in safeguarding the 
political, social, cultural, economic and religious life of their people. Although elders BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮What do you think about the roles of indigenous knowledge 
in producing responsible citizens?81
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookdischarge this moral responsibility as members of their respective community and 
citizens of the country, it doesn’t mean that this role is left only to them. It is a moral 
obligation of everyone to pass down from generation to generations. Young people 
inherit this tradition from elders because, they are tomorrow’s elders. For instance, 
in Arsi Oromo, there is a culture in which the father takes his young son to the place 
where Jaarsummaa takes place. The main aim of doing this is to give exposure to 
the son as to how conflicts are resolved through Jaarsummaa. So, in all communities 
in one way or another there are similar traditions of producing responsible citizens 
through indigenous based knowledge systems. 
Making active participations in the socio-economic activities of a society is one of 
the responsibilities expected of citizens. 
Activity 4.2
1. Being in  groups containing five students each and ask  local 
elders about the practices and the roles of those indigenous 
conflict resolution mechanisms mentioned above and others  
found in your community in resolving conflicts and ensuring 
sustainable peace. Then, present your findings to the class.
Role Play 
Role play an indigenous conflict resolution mechanism which 
is commonly 
practiced in your community. Then, demonstrate it in the class. 82
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookOne of the ways by which citizens can contribute their part in socio-economic 
transformations of their societies is by introducing and using indigenous technologies. 
Indigenous technologies and practices are very important for Ethiopia which highly 
depends on outside supplies. 
Indigenous technologies and practices enable citizens to use local products with 
reasonable costs and better accessibility as compared to the pricey and scarce 
imported products. Indigenous technologies also provide valuable options for local 
people than the western technologies. 
There are different indigenous technologies that have been in use for a long period 
of time in different parts of Ethiopia. For example, pottery, iron smiths, jewelry, 
weaving, wood carving, leather works are the major ones. The peoples who are 
engaged in these works maintained these indigenous knowledges from endangerment 
or disappearance with great dedications and resisting the deep rooted negative 
societal attitudes towards them. This clearly indicates their real determination, hard 
work valuing and respecting   their own indigenous wisdoms which are the true 
attributes of responsible or good citizens.  
Figure 4.2:    Some of indigenous technologies: weaving (Dorze weaving), iron smith, 
wood carving
83
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookIndigenous environmental conservation mechanisms
Environmental conservation refers to the wise use of resources available in the 
natural environment. Environmental conservation and preservation is one of the 
most contemporary global issues that seeks the attention of everyone because, 
the life of both human beings and animals depend on the well conserved and 
preserved environment. So, environmental conservation has vital roles for the socio-
economic and ecological benefits of human beings. However, the increasing rate of 
environmental degradations in Ethiopia as well as across the globe is causing great 
adverse effects to human well-being from time to time. 
Activity 4.3
Do question no. 1 as a group work and question no. 2 as an individual 
assignment. 
1. Everyone likes and uses different products produced by 
indigenous technologies in our community. For instance, you 
can take pottery products and weaving products. But, there is a 
serious negative attitude towards those who produce them.  How 
do you see this contradictory assertion of loving the products 
without loving the producers?  
2. On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) observe one indigenous 
technology, for example   pottery, weaving, or stannery, or wood 
carving that is practiced in your area and present to the class 
what you learned from your observations.  84
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookIndigenous knowledge plays a significant role in promoting environmental 
conservation. In Ethiopia, although many people do not give it attention, indigenous 
knowledge has valuable contributions in environmental conservations in different 
communities. Indigenous peoples have strong taboos and cultural nexus with their 
natural environment. For instance, social taboos as indigenous belief systems have 
crucial roles in restricting people from cutting down trees and damaging environment 
carelessly. Konso people’s indigenous knowledge of water and soil conservation or 
terracing and indigenous Agroforestry system of Gedeo community are taken as 
good examples. Thus, the nexus between the environment and culture that exists 
in the particular society imposes moral and social responsibility or prohibition 
mechanisms on its members to conserve their natural environment or not to damage 
it.

institutions87
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookIndigenous social institution refers to institutions established locally by voluntary 
cooperation or association of the members of a given community based on their own 
mutual trust without any instruction from someone/somebody.  Indigenous social 
institution are voluntarily- established by local people mainly to support each other 
in time of difficulty (mourning), to resolve conflict , to serve as  financial sources, 
for information exchange and to cope  different  problems of the members and the 
community in general. 
Figure 4.4: Some of indigenous social institutions in Ethiopia
In Ethiopia indigenous social institutions have significant contributions to the day 
to day life activities of the society. They provide different socio-economic services 
to the members and other needy peoples in the community. There are different types 
of social institutions in Ethiopia that have been practiced for a long period of time 
among different sections of the society. Some of them are,  Iddir, Iqqub, Debo/Jigie, 
Mahber/Senbete, Siinqee, etc...
Siinqee  
Siinqee is, literally, a stick (Ulee) and symbolizes a socially endorsed set of rights 
exercised by women in the Oromoo society. It is a special stick that is used to 
signify legally married women and also to indicate women’s respect and power 
in the society. In the Oromoo Gadaa system, Siinqee is a symbolic representation 
of married women’s participation in the political, economic, social, cultural and 
religious activities. 
88
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookSiinqee culture plays significant roles in protecting women’s rights and ensuring 
gender equality through Siinqee solidarity. If a woman has a Siinqee, she has to be 
respected, and nobody should fight with her. It serves as a weapon of women to fight 
against violation of their rights by their male counterparts.  For instance, Siinqee 
women gather when a husband violates his wife’s rights, for example, by beating 
her, causing bodily injury to her, insulting her, etc. During this time, joining the 
gathering is mandatory for all women in the village. This is because it is believed 
that the violation of one woman’s rights amounts to a violation of the rights of all 
women.  Then, after serious reconciliation process, the husband is asked to pay 
compensation from his private property and slaughter an animal as a symbol of 
reconciliation. In addition to this, he is requested to openly apologize his wife. 
However, if he fails to confess his wrong doings, Siinqee women impose a serious 
curse (the curse of siinqee).  It is believed that the curse of Siinqee will have bad 
consequences on a man. 
Furthermore, Siinqee plays important roles in ensuring peace and resolving conflicts 
in the society. For instance, Siinqee women raise their Siinqee and ask conflicting 
parties to stop fighting immediately and mediate between them to prevent the adverse 
consequences of the conflict. Accordingly, when the women hold the Siinqee and 
parade during a conflict, any conflicting party should surrender and stop the fighting 
at once. 
Iddir
Iddir is an indigenous social institution voluntarily established by the local people 
mainly for self-help and other social activities. Iddir is established primarily to 
provide mutual aid in burial matters and also to address other community concerns.  
Iddir is a social institution which is widely practiced and well known among both 
rural and urban peoples. Peoples can join and become members of Iddir without any 
considerations based on religion, ethnicity and sex. This indicates the democratic 
nature of the institution in treating every one based on the principle of equality .  
The primary objective of Iddir is helping people in funeral activities. Members of 
the institution contribute money and other goods in kind on regular basis that can 
be used during mourning time. In addition to this, iddir plays significant roles in 
coping sudden risks its members face such as death of livestock like oxen, asset 89
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbooklosses due to fire accident or theft and health problems. It also serves the members 
during different ceremonial events like weeding by providing necessary materials. 
Iddir has also a great roles in serving as a credit institution by providing members 
with loans without interest.  In iddir there is also a good culture of conflict resolution 
mechanism when disagreements or disputes arise among the members.
Iqqub
Similar to iddir, iqqub is indigenous social institution voluntarily established by 
people based on mutual trust. The primary objective of Iqqub is providing financial 
services to the members. In iqqub members agreed to collect specific amount of 
money on regular basis by setting specific date (may be per week or per month) on 
which money can be paid to members through lottery method. Thus, Iqqub has crucial 
roles in solving financial problems of the members which cannot be accessible from 
formal financial institutions like banks and microfinance. Iqqub  highly benefits   the  
members  during  market  failure  and  is  used  as  risk  sharing.  It  can  be  used  to  
purchase  durable  goods,  agricultural  inputs,  food  items,  cover  school  fees  or  
any  other  pitfalls.
Mahber or Senbete
Mahber or Senbete are voluntary associations of individuals  to help each other when 
a member may face some serious problems like death, burning down of properties, 
enjoy together and for other social activities. The members of mahber/senbete gather 
together at one common place per week or per month to discuss on different issues 
related to their common interests. In some cases the members prepare foods and 
drinks at their home and serve the members, or bring the foods and drinks to their 
particular religious place and enjoy it together  as well as feed the poor gathered over 
there. This social institution is so vital for individuals to get together to help each 
other and to deal with the concerns of their community.
Debo/Jigie (Labor Sharing)
Debo or Jigie refers to the culture of helping each other among local peoples during 
ploughing, weeding or other events like; harvesting, and building houses and in 
any other social activities. Debo/Jigie has been widely known and practiced in 90
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookdifferent areas of Ethiopia for long time.  For example, in agricultural activities 
when unexpected rain comes during harvesting time, the farmers harvest their crops 
being in Debo/ Jigie to save their crops from damage.  
Generally, the indigenous social institutions discussed above are not the only ones 
practiced by all sections of societies in Ethiopia. There are many other similar social 
institutions that need to be promoted and given great emphasis by all concerned 
bodies. 
Activity 4.5
Do the following questions as group assignment and then present to 
the class.
1. What do you learn from the indigenous social institutions 
discussed above? 
2. Identify any social institution practiced in your community, but 
not discussed above and present it to the class.
Remember
 üIndigenous social institution refers to institutions 
established locally by voluntary cooperation or 
association of the members of a given community. 
 üIndigenous social institutions play significant roles in 
promoting mutual cooperation and resolving different 
problems of a given community. 
 üIn Ethiopia there are different types of indigenous

You have also learned about the roles of indigenous knowledges in producing 
responsible citizens in Ethiopia.  Indigenous knowledges play pivotal roles in 
producing responsible citizens who would actively participate in ensuring sustainable 
peace, socio-economic development, environmental conservations and others. 
In addition to this, there are indigenous social institutions that have significant 
contributions in addressing different community problems. Some of them are, Iddir, 
Eqqub, Siinqee, Mahber/Senbete, Debe/jigi,etc.

5.1.   Understanding culture
     The meaning of culture
Culture refers to a shared language, beliefs, values, norms, behaviors, and material 
objects that are passed from one generation to the next generation. It includes rituals, 
customs, celebrations, dress styles, mode of relationships between and among the 
people, etc. There is no society without culture and cultural values that differentiate 
one society from others. It is a mirror or a lens with which we evaluate everything 
around us; we evaluate what is proper or improper, normal or abnormal using our 
culture. Therefore, culture is a multifaceted concept that includes knowledge, beliefs, 
arts, morals, laws, customs, and habits acquired by humans as members of a society. ⓵⓵
BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮How do you define the word ‘culture’?By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 ☑Define culture 
 ☑Display the values of cultural diversity in a country96
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookCulture of a society embodies different cultural elements like people’s languages, 
myths, rituals, symbols, collective memories, customs and traditions, arts, music, 
etc. These elements of cultures are also used to shape our identity and influence 
our behaviors in our daily lives. Thus, culture and cultural practices in human lives 
constitute different sets of beliefs and views about human being. Proper understanding 
of what constitutes society helps us to respect and value the cultural diversity in a 
multicultural society. In Ethiopia, there are various peoples, cultures and cultural 
practices, and this gives beauty and attraction to our society. For instance, if we 
see the Ethiopian coffee drinking cultures and ceremonies in different parts of 
the country, it is what we have to be proud of and make it maintained by the new 
generation. 
Learning about cultures helps us to recognize cultural differences and avoid negative 
stereotypes and personal biases toward other societies’ cultures. In addition, cultural 
diversity helps us to recognize and respect “ways of being” that are not necessarily 
our own so that we can interact with others, build bridges to trust, respect, and 
understand other cultures
The prevalence of cultural diversity in the forms of different cultural and ethnic 
identity in multicultural society needs to be properly understood and treated in an 
appropriate manner. Hence, the cultural diversity issues in heterogeneous society 
must be accepted, respected, tolerated and appreciated to effectively manage 
diversity issue in diversified societies.BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮Do you think there is a uniform culture and cultural practices 
within one country? If your answer is ‘No’ why?97
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookFigure 5.1:  Diverse culture of Ethiopian societies
Cultural diversity helps us to understand different perspectives within the world in 
which we live in. This diversity makes one country a more interesting place to live, 
as people from diverse cultures contribute language skills, new ways of thinking, 
new knowledge, and different experiences. Therefore, recognizing cultural diversity 
within a society is the base for multiculturalism and diversity issue management.
We can support cultural diversity in our society by;
• Increasing our understanding about other cultures by interacting with people 
outside of our own cultures.
• Avoiding imposing values on that of others as it may conflict or be inconsistent 
with own culture.
• Advocating for the use of materials that are representative of the various 
cultural groups within the local community and the society in the workplace, 
educational setting, etc.
• Intervening in an appropriate manner when others engage in behaviors that 
show cultural insensitivity, bias, or prejudice.
• Be proactive in listening, accepting, and welcoming people and ideas that 
are different from our own.

2. Why is recognition and accommodation of cultural diversity 
being important to our country?Remember
 üCulture is the lens in which we evaluate our

either different or contradictory to ours. This refers to 
the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society,

5.2.      The concept of multiculturalism
     The meaning of MULTICULTURALISM
In modern societies the management of cultural diversity within state has become 
an increasingly prominent issue in countries like Ethiopia. In those states employing 
an appropriate diversity management policy approaches are the burning issues of 
political and national agenda. Multiculturalism is the best strategy to deal with 
diversity accommodation to maintain and preserve a country’s national unity out of 
diverse identities. Thus, multiculturalism is a movement that;

 ☑Practice multiculturalism as a viable policy for peaceful

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook• Recognizes cultural diversity as a national asset rather than a liability .
The term “ culturally diverse ” is often used interchangeably with the term 
“multiculturalism’’. Cultural diversity is a system of beliefs and behaviors that 
recognizes and respects  the presence of all diverse groups in a society, acknowledges 
and values  their socio-cultural differences. Important actions that are involved in 
the concept of multiculturalism include:
• Recognition of the abundant diversity of cultures and respect for the 
differences;
• Acknowledging the validity of different cultural expressions and 
contributions;
• Empowering people to strengthen themselves and others to achieve their 
maximum potential by being critical of their own biases; and
• Tolerating and appreciating differences in order to bring about unity through 
diversity.
Multiculturalism is therefore, a policy and strategy used to maintain unity within 
diversity in multi-ethnic or multicultural states. It is appropriate ways and means to 
accommodate diversity issue in culturally diverse society.
Multiculturalism is a body of thought about the proper way to respond to cultural 
and religious diversity. It is a system of belief and behavior used to recognize and 
respect the presence of all diverse groups in a society. It acknowledges and values 
the socio-cultural differences in a society. If we find different beliefs, values, customs 
and traditions and life styles dissimilar with that of ours can get awareness of the 
differences that among individuals relating to their sex, race, religion, and ethnicity.
Maintaining a striking balance between national unity and cultural diversity is 
worthwhile for a stable multicultural society. In the policy of multicultural federalism, BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮How multiculturalism is used to promote unity in diversity?101
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookthe issues of language equality and cultural and ethnic identity were emphasized 
more and this leads to a tendency of ethnocentrism because citizens’ national or 
ethnic identities were more pronounced than the national unity and identity of the 
Ethiopian state. This has become a potential threat to process of building national 
unity and common identity among Ethiopian citizens. Thus, multiculturalism and 
multicultural federalism in today’s Ethiopia has been adopted to reconcile the 
imbalance between upholding ethnic and national identity by maintaining unity 
within diversity.

Remember
 üMulticulturalism in contemporary political discourse and in political 
philosophy reflects a debate about how to understand and respond 
to the challenges associated with cultural diversity based on ethnic, 
national, and religious differences. 
 üIn a multicultural society, every culture is unique in itself in a specific 
society and cultural uniformity is uncommon in diversified societies. 
 üThe prevalence of cultural diversity in the forms of different cultural 
and ethnic identity in multicultural society needs to be properly 
understood and treated in an appropriate manner. 
 üCurrently, multiculturalism is alternative policy to a cultural 
assimilation and national integration in which the value of cultural 
diversity is not recognized and appreciated due to mono-cultural

 Basic pillars of multiculturalism
Pillars of multicultural societies refer to the proper ways to respond to diversity issues 
in the society. They are basic principles that are used to treat or deal with diversity 
as pillars of multicultural societies as appropriate means and ways to accommodate 
diversity. Therefore, diversity management in multicultural society involves proper 
response and appropriate ways to accommodate cultural diversity. To build the sense 
of national unity and solidarity among all diverse groups, it must be recognition and 
respect for society’s diverse cultures, religion, languages, customs and traditions.⓷⓷

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook 
Figure 5.2:    The solidarity between Ethiopian Muslims and Christians
1. Accepting and respecting differences
In multicultural society, differences in cultural values, belief system, and views or 
outlooks are usually accepted. To appreciate and recognize differences, we have to 
respect and support each other despite the differences in their cultural backgrounds. 
If differences are accepted and accommodated in the right ways of diversity 
management it will used to escape sense of inequality and suspicion among the 
members of the society. When we come across differences in our community, we 
need to accept that difference positively and respect the differences rather than 
discrediting and devaluing them based on our own standards. If differences are 
accepted and respected they help to create coexistence and harmonious relationships 
among the members of the society. It also facilitates mutual acceptance of differences 
within the society; and respect for the consequences of these differences (in social 
and cultural values, beliefs and ways of life). 
2. Tolerance and appreciation to differences
Another value and pillar of multicultural society that helps to deal with diversity 
issue is tolerance and appreciation to differences in the society. Multicultural 
societies are characterized by diverse people’s socio-cultural, religious, ethnic 
and historical background. However, to treat these differences properly we have 
104
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookto tolerate indifferent values, belief and outlook. Tolerance is a sense of openness 
to difference and diversity, and objective attitude of mind or way of thinking 
towards different genders, races, religions and nationalities. Tolerance is bedrock of 
multiculturalism in diverse societies like Ethiopia. To properly understand diversity 
issue in multicultural society tolerance is used to accept different behaviors, practices, 
opinions, beliefs and standpoints in a diverse society.
Remember
 üDiversity encompasses culture, race, gender, religion, 
age, disability and career status and we should take all 
these into account and simultaneously safeguard as well 
in all our interpersonal relations and communications. 
 üIn multicultural society, accepting and respecting 
diversity and tolerating and appreciating differences 
are the basic pillars used to deal with diversity issue 
 üAccepting and accommodating differences is the right 
way of accommodating and appreciating diversity. If 
differences are accepted and accommodated is the right 
ways of diversity management.
 üIf differences are accepted and respected they help 
to create coexistence and harmonious relationships 
among the members of the society.105

5.4.     Major forms of diversity demonstrating multiculturalism
 Basic pillars of multiculturalism
Multicultural societies are characterized by existence of cultural, ethnic and 
religious diversities to be recognized, accepted, respected and celebrated. There is 
diversity and distinctions among the peoples’ in gender, culture, religion, ethnicity 
and socioeconomic background. Considering this diversity and multiculturalism is 
important in the context of nation building. Ethiopia is a country, of diversity and the 
major forms of diversity demonstrated includes; ethnic diversity, cultural diversity, 
linguistic diversity, and religious diversity.⓸⓸

multinational state?By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 ☑Identify the basic elements of diversity in multiculturalism
 ☑Explain forms of diversity demonstrating multiculturalism
 ☑Seek to develop multicultural behaviors amidst major 
forms of diversity 106
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook1. Ethnicity 
Ethnicity and ethnic identity is one of the major forms of diversity demonstrated in 
multicultural societies like Ethiopia. 
In multicultural society ethnicity is the basic elements that indicate multiculturalism 
that existed in the forms of membership and belongingness to ethnic group. Ethnic 
groups are people that identify themselves with a social grouping on cultural grounds, 
including language and origins. The basis of ethnicity is, therefore, often a tradition 
of common descent or intermarriage and shared culture or history . 
Figure 5.3:    Photos of some Ethiopian ethnic group
Ethnicity gives an individual a sense of belonging and ethnic identity. Ethnic groups 
are groups with a scribed membership, usually but not always based on claims or 
myths of common history, ancestry, language, race, religion, culture and territory. 
Ethnic identity is therefore, a manner in one persons, on account of their ethnic 
origin, locate themselves psychologically in relation to one or more social systems, 
and in which they perceive others as locating them in relation to those systems. 
In multicultural society ethnicity and identifying oneself is natural phenomena as 
107
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookthere are diverse ethnic groups within one society and it cannot be a challenge to 
multiculturalism. But if ethnicity and ethnic identity develops to ‘ethnocentrism,’ it 
could be a potential threat to multiculturalism and multicultural issue understanding.
 2. Religion 
Religious diversity is one of the common features indicating existence of diverse 
religion and belief system in the society. 
Religious pluralism generally refers to the belief in two or more religious worldviews 
as being equally valid or acceptable. In societies with religious diversity, religious 
tolerance dictates that different religions should live in harmony with each other, 
accepting and allowing for religious diversity. Ethiopia is a country of diverse 
religions living together for a long period of time. For instance, Christians and 
Muslims have been living together for a long period of time peacefully based on 
mutual respect and tolerance. 
3. Gender
Gender diversity is an umbrella term that is used to describe gender identities 
that demonstrate a diversity of expression. Gender refers to the array of socially 
constructed roles and relationships, personality traits, attitudes, behaviors, values, 
relative power and influence that society ascribes to the two sexes on a differential 
basis. It refers to the attitudes, feelings, and behaviors that a given culture associates 
with a person’s biological sex. Gender is a social construct that defines and 
differentiates the roles, rights, responsibilities, and what is appropriate behavior and 
obligation for women and men. 
4. Disability 
The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and respect. It means understanding 
that each individual is unique, and recognizing our individual differences. It is 
about understanding each other and moving beyond simple tolerance to embracing 
and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity contained within each individual. 
By embracing disability as a natural part of diversity, we enhance our own self-
awareness and knowledge of the world around us.108
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook5. Linguistic Diversity
If the people of a particular society interact with others by making use of a variety 
of languages, the society can be said to have linguistic diversity. Some countries 
or societies have got different languages with lots of sub versions. Linguistic 
diversity gives extra attraction to such societies; as such societies possess different 
kinds of literary writings and linguistic symbols. More over language is one of the 
most important aspects of culture and a society in which people speaks different 
languages can promote different cultural entities. Multilingualism is the ability of 
an individual speaker or a community of speakers to communicate effectively in 
three or more languages. In contrast to this, mono-lingualism, the ability to speak 
only one language and a person who can speak multiple languages is known as a 
multilingual.
Activity 5.3

presented above. Group leader should present the result to the class.
1. What are the diversities that demonstrate 
multiculturalism in the communities you come from?
2. What are the shared cultural elements that exist in most parts of 
Ethiopia?109
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookUnit Summary
Culture is a mirror which the members of cultural groups used to identify themselves 
in the society. Culture of a society include a collection of beliefs, values, behaviors, 
customs, and attitudes that distinguish the people of one society from those of others. 
Cultural diversity is the common feature of diversified societies. In a multicultural 
society, every culture is unique in itself and cultural uniformity is uncommon in 
diversified societies. The prevalence of cultural diversity in the forms of different 
cultural and ethnic identity in multicultural society needs to be properly understood 
and treated in appropriate manner. 
Multiculturalism is the best strategy to deal with diversity accommodate it maintain 
and preserve a country’s national unity within diverse identities. Therefore, 
multiculturalism, as an alternative policy option and strategy, is used to create national 
unity instead of national integration and cultural assimilation policy. Currently, it is 
an alternative policy to a cultural assimilation and national integration in which the 
value of cultural diversity is not recognized and appreciated due to mono-cultural 
national policy. 
In Ethiopia, diversity has been treated in different ways by ignoring, eliminating and 
excluding diversity through cultural assimilation and ‘mono-culturalism’, a diversity Remember

6.2.     Elements of diversity
 The meaning of unity in diversity
Diversity can be broadly conceived of as all the ways that people are different. This 
includes both visible and invisible differences that exist between people both at 
the individual and group level. It refers to “differences between individuals on any 
attribute that may lead to the perception that another person is different from the 
self, or a variation that exists within and across groups on the basis of race, ethnicity, 
language, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and social status. Celebrating unity 
through diversity means we can achieve unity by acknowledging and respecting 
the rich diversity that exists in our society today. Now, diversity is a growing and 
progressive part of our society, but what makes diversity important?⓶⓶

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookDiversity is very useful for a diverse country. It allows people of different religions, 
and cultures to live together peacefully. It is used to signify unity among individuals 
who have certain differences among them on the basis of culture, language, ideology, 
religion, ethnicity, etc. Therefore, all diversified societies are characterized by 
multiculturalism, political pluralism, religious diversity as elements of diversity . 
In Ethiopia, people of diverse customary institutions, religions, cultures, historical 
backgrounds, etc. have been living together. They have been living together for many 
centuries and this shows the intense tolerance and unity of the Ethiopian people. 
The major element of diversity characterizing culturally diverse society includes 
presence of diverse cultural, religious, ethnic, linguistic and etc., groups.
1) Cultural diversity
Cultural diversity is one of the essential elements multicultural society recognized 
and respected to respond to diversity issue properly. Cultural diversity in modern 
societies take many forms. It refers to the view that cultures, races, and ethnicities, 
particularly those of minority groups, deserve special acknowledgment of their 
differences within a dominant political culture. In the true cultural diversity, there 
is no culture which is superior to other cultures. Similarly, no culture is inferior 
to any other culture and all cultures should be seen equally. People in different 
parts of Ethiopia use traditional clothes when they go to church or mosque and at 
times of weddings and holidays. Having cultural diversity means having different 
dressing styles, traditional foods and cultural dances, all of which make Ethiopia 
beautiful and interesting. This helps us to properly accommodate cultural diversity 
for maintaining ‘national unity’ within diversity.   
2) Religious diversity
Religion is a cultural manifestation which we have to respect.  When we respect the 
religions of others, it means that we respect their culture.  This enables us to live 
in harmony as citizens of one country. Religious diversity is one of the common 
features indicating existence of diverse religions and belief systems in the society. 
Religious diversity is the fact that there are significant differences in religious beliefs 
and practices. 
Ethiopia is a country of religious diversity known as the land of peace and religious 
tolerance.  121
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook3) Linguistic diversity
If the people of a particular society interact with others by making use of a variety 
of languages, the society can be said to have linguistic diversity. Some countries 
or societies have got different languages with lots of sub versions. Linguistic 
diversity gives extra attraction to such societies; as such societies possess different 
kinds of literary writings and linguistic symbols. More over language is one of the 
most important aspects of culture and a society in which people speaks different 
languages can promote different cultural entities. Multilingualism is the ability of 
an individual speaker or a community of speakers to communicate effectively in 
three or more languages. In contrast to this, mono-lingualism, the ability to speak 
only one language and a person who can speak multiple languages is known as a 
multilingual.

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookof diversity differences are accepted, accommodation implies to the right way to 
diversity management. Diversity management is a process intended to create and 
maintain a positive work environment where the similarities and differences of 
individuals are valued. It is the policy approach deals diversity issues aimed at 
cultural accommodation and national integration in nation building process.
While accommodation requires the recognition of more than one ethnic, linguistic, 
national, religious community in the state and aims to secure the coexistence of 
different communities within the state, integration aims at equal citizenship and at 
privatization of differences. Therefore, accommodation of diversity can be achieved 
when the society’s components demonstrate mutual acceptance of differences within 
the society; and respect for the consequences of these differences.

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookManagement of cultural diversity within a state has become an increasingly 
prominent issue in recent times not only in developed countries but also in developing 
countries like Ethiopia. In modern times, although members of society share broadly 
common culture, they entertain different beliefs and practices concerning certain 
significant areas of human life. Cultural diversity and multiculturalism are the terms 
very commonly used to describe societies of different cultures, religions, languages 
and races. 
Ways to accommodate diversity in multicultural societies
There are different ways to manage diversity and realize national integration in a 
multiethnic or multicultural state. Accommodating diversity is alternative way to 
cultural assimilation and national integration which are adopted to manage diversity 
in many countries. In many countries the nation-state has had a major role in forming 
strategies for diversity. State strategies used by the nation state as a way of managing 
diversity and creating national unity include;
A.  Ignoring diversity and adopting the policy of assimilation,
B.  Recognizing diversity and promoting the diversities
In this regard, the experiences of some state have shown that ignoring, eliminating 
and excluding diversity are mistaken and impractical action because when the 
suppressed groups emerge and adopt violent means to restore their rights. However, 
accommodating diversity is attainable in plural states through “multicultural 
federalism since it accommodates as all ethnic, religious and linguistic differences. 
Today, federal political systems are increasingly used by states with a multi-ethnic 
population as a mechanism to accommodate the demands of their ethnic groups as 
well as to protect their territorial integrity. Federal political systems are thus created 
to prevent, resolve or at least mitigate ethnically inspired or associated conflicts and 
in this way to ensure stability within the state.126

6.4.     The importance of diversity management in Ethiopia
Diversity management in Ethiopia
Ethiopia contains over 80 different ethnic groups and each ethnic group has tribes 
and sub-tribes. Each ethnic group has distinct cultural practices and speaks a 
language specific to the ethnic group. Due to improper governmental orientations 
by, large numbers of people, the majority perhaps, identify themselves with their 
ethnic identities than their country common identity because they were not told 
to assimilate into their state. Similarly, nation-state building project in the past 
resulted in the existence of a dominant national group create with a cover up for the 
“majority’s” culture, language, religion to national culture, language and religion. ⓸⓸

Ethiopia128
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookAs a result of this, there was resistance to national domination, interethnic tension 
and rivalry among the groups. 
The notion of national majorities versus national minorities has become a challenging 
issue to forge out of diversity failed to reflect the existing diversity on the ground. 
Due to this maintaining national unity has remained to be the challenge for the 
Ethiopian state. The question of building unity from diversity from a multicultural 
state and federal system has been adopted as a solution for incorporating both unity 
and diversity. Therefore, managing diversity through accommodating diversity 
while maintaining unity and avoiding fragmentation are highly needed in the current 
Ethiopian nation-building process. Hence, an approach or means that is used to 
accommodate diversity can determine the success or failure of a state in multicultural 
societies in general and in Ethiopia in particular.
Generally, to effectively make a balance between maintaining national unity and 
accommodating diversity, in appropriate manner in contemporary Ethiopia, it is 
very important to consider several historical, political, and socio-cultural factors. 
Case Study
Abdella is a new graduate teacher who was assigned to work in a 
community where Christians are dominant. He is from a society in which 
the majority are Muslims. Upon hearing his assignment, some of his close 
relatives advise him not to go to this work place. They just thought that 
Abdella will not be welcomed by that community simply because of his 
religion. However, Abdella rejected their advice and went to the work 
place. When he arrived there, he was surprised with the warm welcome of 
the community and their respect for cultural and religious diversity. The 
community always celebrates the holidays of both Christians and Muslims 
together and they are always proud of having a diverse society129
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookThe need to have a balance between unity through diversity 
A very crucial balance between unity and diversity within society is not an easy goal 
to achieve. In forging unity in diversity in multicultural societies the most important 
thing is the balance between diversity and unity within one country. It is obvious 
that one state has to work to create national unity and common identity in nation 
building processes. But when we only focus on collective similarities as a means 
of achieving unity within diversity, we homogenize one another and thus harm a 
genuine solidarity of diversity.
Accordingly, when we try to create national integration and common national unity 
and identity among all nations, we have to recognize and respect differences in 
language, religious, identity, cultural values and historical background. This means 
to ensure the state national unity and common identity those differences must be 
respected and recognized not eliminated and avoided. 
Now-a-day appreciation and recognition of diversity is understood not only as a 
solution to challenges related to diversity but also used as an alternative means 
to achieve national integration in diversified societies.  National unity involves 
awareness of common identity and national feeling among the citizens of the country 
for national unity and national integrity. Here, for effective national integration 
and unity in diversity, although they have different religions and speak different 
languages they must recognize and believe that they are all one. When feelings of 
unity and harmony are in the hearts of the peoples a sense of common citizenship or 
feeling of loyalty to the nation will be fostered among the citizens of the state. 
Ethiopia has more than 80 ethnic groups which have distinct cultural traditions and

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbooklanguages. Balancing national unity and diversity in Ethiopia is a very important 
task. Our population is characterized by a complex pattern of ethnic, linguistic 
and religious groups and these aspects of diversity are considered significant 
distinguishing features of the country. Therefore, to effectively maintaining Ethiopian 
national unity out of diverse ethnic identities, religion, cultures, and socio-political 
differences, the need to balance between ‘unity and diversity’ is very critical issue 
to the Ethiopian nation building project. This means to make a ‘united Ethiopia’ 
and common national feeling among all Ethiopians, recognition and promotion for 
diverse ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious differences is equally important as 
the nations’ national unity.
Remember
 üDiversity management is a process aimed to create and 
maintain a positive work environment where the similarities 
and differences of individuals are valued.
 üIn Ethiopian nation-building process, accommodating 
diversity issues and maintaining national unity are 
equally important, balancing national unity and diversity 
in Ethiopia is a very important task
 üIn forging unity in diversity in multicultural societies the 
most important thing is the balance between diversity and 
unity within one country.
 üMaintaining a balance between promoting national unity 
and accommodating diversity is very essential for Ethiopian 
nation state 
 üIn Ethiopia, to ensure the state national unity and common 
identity differences must be respected and recognized not 
eliminated and avoided.131
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookUnit Summary
Now-a-day, maintaining unity within diversity is the national agenda of many states 
with in different degrees. To effectively accommodate diversity and develop common 
national identity ‘unity in diversity is believed to be the right approach. Unity in 
diversity means oneness in a variety of peoples of many religions, races, cultures 
and traditions living together. National unity can be understood as the process of 
unifying a society to make it harmonious. Therefore, national unity within one state 
is taken a building block for state-building or nation-building and state formation 
processes. 
 Celebrating unity through diversity means we can achieve unity by acknowledging 
and respecting the rich diversity that exists in our society today. In Ethiopia, people 
of diverse customary institutions, religions, cultures, historical backgrounds, etc. 
have been living together. They have been living together for many centuries and this 
shows the intense tolerance and unity of the Ethiopian people. The major element 
of diversity characterizing culturally diverse society includes presence of diverse 
cultural, religious, ethnic, linguistic and etc., groups.
In contemporary multicultural societies, accommodation of diversity has been 
adopted as opposed to national integration as distinct strategy to deal with cultural 
diversity. It is alternative ways to cultural assimilation when dealing with cultural 
diversity. Diversity management is a process intended to create and maintain a positive 
work environment where the similarities and differences of individuals are valued. 
It is the policy approach deals diversity issues aimed at cultural accommodation and 
national integration in nation building process.
There are different ways to manage diversity and realize national integration in a 
multiethnic or multicultural state. Accommodating diversity is alternative way to 
cultural assimilation and national integration which are adopted to manage diversity 
in many countries. In many countries the nation state has had a major role in forming 
strategies for diversity. Today, federal political systems are increasingly used by 
states with a multi-ethnic population as a mechanism to accommodate the demands 
of their ethnic groups as well as to protect their territorial integrity .132

Meaning of problem-solving skills
Before we define the concept of problem solving, it is better to discuss what we 
mean by problems that we may face in everyday life. The meaning of the word 
problem may be different for different people based on the difficulty and nature of 
the problem someone encounter. However, understanding what exactly is meant by 
problem is very important to find the solution for the problem we are talking about. 
Therefore, defining problems in appropriate manner is critically important to find 
the solution for our problems and get success in all aspects of life.
A problem is an unpleasant situation that prevents people from achieving what ⓵⓵

 ☑Describe problem solving skills
 ☑Explain the abilities to solve problems137
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookthey want, to and the operation they undertake is called to solving a problem. We 
may face problems in our everyday life and success in our life depends on ways 
of solving that problem. Some problems are so simple and others are difficult that 
cannot be addressed by our limited capacity and ability independently. However, 
some problems are understood as challenges we encounter in every day activities of 
our life and the value we have makes problem difficult or easy to overcome. Thus, 
to solve a problem easily we need to define and understand problem before finding 
the solution for it.
Problem-solving skills are valuable intellectual abilities and capacities for leading a 
successful life. Being able to effectively solve problems is essential for any person 
in his/her overall career development. In its’ broader sense, problem solving is the 
act of defining a problem, determining the cause of the problem, identifying and 
selecting alternatives for the solution and implementing the solution. It involves 
different methods and techniques used to resolve specific personal and social 
problems by available knowledge and skills. It refers to the ability to identify the 
nature of the problem, break it down and develop an effective set of actions to 
address the challenges related to it. It includes being able to recognize and specify 
the problem, bring out or create a possible and alternate resolution, figure out and 
choose the best alternative, and put into action the selected solution. Thus, problem 
solving is a process that uses steps to solve problems. What is the difference between 
problem solving and decision making?
Problem solving and decision making  are inter-linked and solving a problem 
tactfully involves making right decisions. Decision making is about selecting the 
right option from a number of available alternatives. On the other hand, problem 
solving is about finding answers to complicated issues and problems. As a result, in BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮What does it mean by problem solving skill?138
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookthe problem-solving process, an individual must be able to combine the appropriate 
operations and apply them to the solution.
The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day 
lives at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really 
thinking about how we solve them. For example, suppose that you are a stranger to 
a place and face a problem of finding the exact place you want to go.  You can solve 
this problem easily by asking someone there to tell you the direction to the place 
you want to go. Similarly, suppose that you lose your bag with mobile phone in a 
bus while going to visit your relatives living in a city for the first time. Because of 
that you could not call your relatives. Your pocket is also empty as you have lost 
your money with the bag in the bus. This is a serious problem.  The solution for this 
problem needs creative problem solving and critical thinking skill.
Therefore, problem-solving skills are the most important skills that help us to 
become successful in achieving our personal and common goals in life. Being able 
to effectively solve problems is beneficial in nearly any position and can support 
a person’s overall career advancement. Problem-solving skills help individuals to 
efficiently and effectively find solutions to issues. There is no right way to solve a 
given problem and different people will solve it differently. However, to become 
successful, the best problem solvers use various methods for solving problems.

The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day 
lives, at home, at school, and at work. Effective problem-solving involves several 
skills within the problem-solving process, and each career may require specific 
problem-solving skills. We solve problems every day without really thinking about 
how we solve them using experience and indigenous knowledge and skills. This skill 
is considered to be a soft skill, or an individual strength, as opposed to a learned hard 
skill. This means everybody may have this skill without having formal education 
and training in different degrees of application. 
There are various indigenous problem-solving skills in every society that are used 
to resolve different problems people face in their life.  In this regard we have ample 
social skills that are used to resolve our social and individual problems in our 
individual and collective life. These problem-solving skills include negotiation skill, 
cooperative or collaborative skill, diversity tolerance skill and others. In addition

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookTherefore, good problem solvers are people who use a combination of intuition and 
logic to come up with the best solutions. 
Problem solving keeps you moving forward and it is essential for getting work 
done. Effective problem solvers take the steps in order and apply them literally. 
Most intelligent problem solvers recognize that there is almost always more than 
one solution, so they develop several alternatives from which to choose. Problem 
solving skills are as varied as the issues they are applied to and effective problem 
solvers share common characteristics.
 Some of the general characteristics of good problem solvers are:
A. They have clear definition of the problems at hand 
B.  They are reasonably open minded but logically skeptical 
C.  They look for opportunity within the problem

questions
1. Do all problems need to be solved using the same 
problem-solving skill? Is problem solving skill based 
on the difficulty and nature of the problem? 
2. To be a good problem solver, how can someone develop 
or improve his/her problem-solving skills?146
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook7.3.2.      Stages of problem-solving processes
Problem solving is the process of identifying a problem, developing possible 
solution paths, and taking the appropriate course of action. To solve any problem 
effectively and become good problem solver, we have to pass through certain steps 
in the problem-solving process. Good problem solvers are people who properly 
follow these steps and respond to the issue in each step accordingly.  This is what we 
call stages of problem solving. They need to be considered in any problem-solving 
process. To solve or clarify any problem, there are many systematic methods and 
ways which we call as a process of problem-solving. Problem solving requires a 
methodical step-by-step approach to a challenge. 
Figure 7.3:    Stages of problem solving
Here are some basic stages of problem-solving we can follow when approaching a 
problem in our personal life.
Step 1: Define the Problem
• The first step for you will be to define the problem. Then try to identify the 
roots causes or sources of the problem and the nature of the problem by 
asking questions and looking at the problems from different angles. It is very 
important to understand the problems and the challenges you would face 
while addressing them. Once you clearly understand the problem, you find 
the right solutions for that problem by using your problem-solving skills.
147
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookStep 2: Brainstorm 
• Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, the next step is to dig 
a little deeper into the situation and collect as many facts as you can about 
the problem to get a clear picture of it.  The best way to gather information 
is by asking questions to those who are connected or related to the problem 
or situation. This is one of the most important stages of problem-solving that 
requires a careful balance of creativity and logical thinking. 
Step 3: Decide on the solution
• Strong decision-making is essential at this stage. After carefully considering 
all options, you must select the best strategy for the problem and stick to your 
choice. After you have identified the problem and collected information, the 
next step for you is to organize all the collected information and then analyze 
it. While you do your analysis, try to build links and relationships in order 
of better understand the problem. Once you have done the proper analysis, 
breaking down the big problem into smaller pieces, it will help you find 
different solutions to it.
Step 4: Implement the Solution
• Implementation is the critical peak of the problem-solving process. This is 
where you draw up an action plan, share it with the appropriate personnel, 
and follow through with chosen approach. When you have chosen the best 
solution according to your requirements, and you are committed to that 
particular solution, now it’s time to put it into action. Implementation of the 
solution is a key to get the best possible outcome, and hence this process 
needs careful attention. Sometimes, even the best solution could fail because 
of ineffective implementation. So, it is necessary to implement the plan most 
efficiently in order to avoid unforeseen problems. After you have completed 
the above steps, you just need to use your critical thinking ability and 
analytical thinking ability to create logical links between different potential 
solutions.  148

7.4.1.      Meaning of creative problem-solving 
Problem -solving involves diagnosing the possible causes of a problem and developing 
an action plan that solves that problem. Problem -solving skills are soft skills that 
help you analyze a problem or challenge to create an effective solution. People use 
problem -solving skills all the time, both in their personal and professional lives. 
The effectiveness of problem-solving process is mostly determined by the approach ⓸⓸
BrainstormingBrainstorming
 偮What is creative problem-solving skill?By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 ☑Apply creative thinking to solve problems
 ☑Evaluate ways to improve one’s problem solving skills
 ☑Apply critical thinking to solve problems150
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookand strategy we employ to solve  the problem. As a result of this, developing the 
skill of creative problem -solving requires constant improvement to encourage 
an environment of consistent innovation. Therefore, problem -solving skills are 
an essential part of everyone’s life as it enables him/her to take control of his/her 
surroundings. 
Creative problem -solving is an approach that identifies unique solutions to issues 
through a process of problem identification and resolution planning. Creative 
problem-solving is considered a soft skill, or personal strength. It involves analyzing 
an issue, defining an approach and implementing a solution and it requires creative 
problem-solving activities. These exercises are techniques on how to improve 
problem solving skills and the art of problem solving.  Effective problem-solving 
involves several skills within the problem-solving category, and each career may 
require specific problem-solving skills. Problem solving requires people to think 
critically and creatively. What is critical thinking? What is creative thinking? 
1. Critical thinking for problem solving
Critical thinking can be described as the ability to engage in reflective and independent 
thinking. It is the ability to think clearly and rationally, understanding the logical 
connection between ideas. Critical thinking skills enable you to analyze information 
and process it rationally to help you determine the value of that information or make 
a decision. Good critical thinkers focus on facts, and on the scientific evaluation of 
the information at hand. 
Moral integrity, ethical consideration and action, and global citizenship practices are 
all symbols of effective critical thinkers. Critical thinking is important to be open-
minded and critical analysis to be and being fair and reasonable. Critical thinking 
is the process to rationally analyze and attempt to solve a problem accurately and 
efficiently. 
2. Creative thinking for problem solving 
Effective critical thinkers are also largely creative thinkers. Creative thinkers are one 
who think ‘outside the box’. When solving problems, creativity can help to think of 
new methods, approaches and solutions for the problem. Creative problem-solving 
skill is the ability and capability to move to clarify the trouble in an impressive 151
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookand at the right time. Creativity can help to effectively and refine our designs to 
increase efficiency. The difference between critical thinkers and creative thinkers 
is that creativity is associated with generating ideas, while critical thinking is 
associated with analyzing and evaluating those ideas. Creative problem solving 
involves the ability to think critically and rationally to easily overcome the problem 
we encountered independently.
7.4.2.      Problem solving skill as attributes of good citizens
Problem solving involves using available information to identify and design 
solutions to problems. Our capacity to develop solutions to problems defines our 
ability to have good problem-solving skills. This involves our soft social skills that 
help us to become competent and responsible citizen for our actions and decisions 
in our day-to-day life. Thus, a good problem solver must have attributes of good 
citizen and a problem solver must show this disposition.  
Good citizens are ones who display various social and problem solving skill. Problem 
solving skill is one of the most important qualities of good citizens. Problem solving 
skills are used to be applied to resolve different interpersonal problems in the 
conflict management and resolution processes. Moreover, good attributes of citizen 
involve social skills that helps to improve individuals’ problem solving skills which 
good citizens are expected to exercise in their daily life. The primary attributes of 
good citizens that help to improve problem solving skills are conflict resolution and 
critical thinking skills.
I. Conflict resolution skills
Within relationships conflicts are inevitable, learning to deal with them in a healthy 
way is crucial. When conflict is mismanaged, it can harm the relationship. But when 
it is handled in a respectful and positive way, conflict provides an opportunity for 
growth, ultimately strengthening the bond between the parties. Successful conflict 
resolution depends on:
▪ The capacity to recognize and respond to important matters 
▪ The readiness to forgive and forget
▪ The ability to seek compromise and avoid punishing
▪ The belief that resolution can support the interests and needs of both parties152
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookII. Critical thinking skills
Critical thinking is the process of rationally analyzing and attempting to solve a 
problem  accurately and efficiently. It is a cognitive skill or a mental process or the 
ability to think rationally and clearly. A critical thinker is a person who possesses the 
following characteristics:
• Is open-minded
• Is logical or rational
• Is willing to reassess information
• Considers a wide range of perspectives
techniques employed in different contexts can determine our problem-solving ability.

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookUnit Summary
In its broader sense, problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining 
the cause of the problem; identifying and selecting alternatives for a solution, and 
implementing a solution. There is no single right way to solve a problem. Different 
people will solve it differently. However, the best problem solvers use various 
methods of solving problems.
Effective problem-solving involves several skills within the problem-solving 
category, every problem may require specific problem-solving skills match with 
the problems encountered. In this regard we have ample social skills that are used 
to resolve our social and individual problems in our individual and collective life. 
Methods and techniques we employ in different contexts can determine how good 
our problem solving ability is. Therefore, good problem solvers are people who 
use a combination of intuition and logic to come up with the solutions. To solve 
problems effectively, we have to pass through certain steps in any problem-solving 
process. Good problem solvers are those who properly follow the steps and response 
to the issue in each step accordingly. The effectiveness of problem-solving process is 
mostly determined by the approach and strategy we employ to address the problem.
Developing the skill of creative problem-solving requires constant improvement

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookThe famous Greek Philosopher Aristotle, describes the natural behavior of human 
being as saying “man is a social animal”. Human beings cannot live in isolation from 
other fellow beings. Human beings fulfill and satisfy their basic needs in association 
with others because; no one is self-sufficient in himself /herself in life.  One way 
or another, a person has to depend on social relationships with others. Just as a 
human being cannot survive in isolation from others, no state can exist or sustain in 
isolation from others states because, each state is not self- sufficient in itself. So, it is 
a must for a particular state to have strong relationships with other states in order to 
fulfill or ensure its national interests. This is called foreign relations.
Foreign relation is defined as the external relations of a country with countries 
of the world.  Ethiopia has long history of foreign relations with other countries 
mainly to protect its national interests and respect for its sovereignty. Regarding 
this, country’s principles for external relations are sated under Article 86 of the 1995 
FDRE constitution. According to this article of the constitution, Ethiopia’s foreign 
relations shall be based on the protection of the national interests of the country 
and ensuring its sovereignty. In addition to this, the constitution states that foreign 
relations of the country are based on mutual benefits and equality of the states, 
observance of international agreements and   non-interference in the internal affairs 
of other states.  Furthermore, Ethiopia’s foreign policy emphasizes on promoting 
mutual economic development and peaceful co-existence and strong public relations 
with its neighbors and other African states.
8.1.1.      National interest
National interest is a key concept in foreign relations. It refers to goals, claims, 
demands which states always seek to achieve, preserve and secure in relations 
with other nations. Every state attempts to achieve or secure its different national 
interests, for example, political, socio-economic, cultural and security interests.   
National interest can also be understood as survival of a state. It is the protection 
of the sovereignty of the state from external interventions or aggressions.  States 
always engage in the process of securing or fulfilling the goals of their national 
interests. Every state formulates its foreign policy to achieve its national interest and 
it is always at work for securing its goals. Securing its national interest is all about a 
universally accepted right of each state. Thus, the behavior and activities of a state 
is always governed by its national interests. 161
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookEven if the national interests of states vary in that detail, core national interests are 
the same for different countries. The minimum essential components of national 
interests of any state are:-
Security, 
National development, and 
World order
All states devise and continuously search for national security, political independence 
and territorial integrity. Maintaining or preserving both domestic and external 
security is among the most priority issues of the national interest of a given state.  The 
absence of peace and security in one state can be a threat to the security of another 
state. For instance, in the Horn of Africa, the longtime  security crises in neighboring 
state Somalia has been a case of concern for Ethiopia and the globe. The second 
component of the core national interest of a state is economic development. Whether 
it is economically advanced state or not, no state stands alone in the global economic 
order. The achievement or success of the socio-economic development of one state 
depends on that of another. A good example for this is Ethio-Djibouti relationships. 
Almost 90 per cent of Ethiopia’s imports arrive via the Port of Djibouti. The third 
component of national interest is the world order. This implies that the place and 
influence or strength of a particular state may be in terms of economy, military 
and geopolitics at international arena. For example, if you take United States of 
America and China, they are super power states in the world currently in leading 
giant economy and military. So, these states have a great influence in the global 
politics, economy and military power in their foreign policies. 162
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookFigure 8.1:    Components of national interest
8.1.2.      Foreign policy
States can realize their foreign relations through their foreign policies. Foreign  
policies  are  the  agreements,  strategies,  methods and  guidelines  that states 
usually    use  to  accomplish  their  actions  in  the  international  arena.  Foreign 
policy is the most important element by which states are able to convert their 
broadly conceived goals and interest into concrete reality. It is a direct reflection of 
a country’s traditional values, aspirations and overall national policies in relations 
to that of others.  A particular state needs to formulate its foreign policies mainly to 
protect its national security, core values and interest, ideological goals and economic 
development.   Foreign policy can also be understood as a blend of ends and means.  
The end refers to   the national interest of a state, whereas the means refers to the 
capabilities or the power of the state to achieve the end. 
Generally, the main aim of foreign policy of a given state is to accomplish its national 
interest and maintain its national ideology. All states are subject to the influence of 
the decisions and actions of other nations. A state without a foreign policy, compared 
with a ship in the deep sea without any knowledge of directions. Thus, foreign 
policy leads a state in fulfilling its national interests and acquiring rightful place in 
the international arena.

8.2.     Instruments of foreign policy
States employ different instruments to implement their foreign policy. Among these 
the major ones are, diplomacy, propaganda, economic tools and military methods.
Diplomacy
Diplomacy refers to the ways states manage their sovereign relations with other 
mutually recognized states. It is the art and practice of conducting negotiations 
between nations. It is the kill of handling affairs without arousing hostility. 
Diplomacy is an instrument or process by which foreign policy is carried out. It is 
used to provide the machinery and the personnel by which foreign policy is executed. ⓶⓶

 ☑Identify the importance of instruments of foreign policy165
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookDiplomacy is not an end but a means, not a purpose but a method. It seeks, by the 
use of reason, conciliation and the exchange of interests, to prevent major conflicts 
arising between sovereign states.
Economic methods  
Economic development is among the core instruments of the foreign policy of states. 
Economically all states across the world are not at the same level or status. In terms 
of the level of economic development, there are well developed nations such as the 
United States of America, European states, China, Japan, India and others. On the 
other hand, there are least developed nations like many African states including 
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan, Kenya, South Sudan, etc.  Since all states are 
economically at various level of development they depend another to meet their 
national economic interests. The economic instrument of foreign policy, thus arises 
from this fact. 
There is no country in the world that has achieved 100 percent independency in 
various aspects of economy, including industries and food. The states have to buy 
the products they do not produce domestically adequately from other states. These 
needs produce dependencies of states in foreign relations.
Military Force
Sometimes states do not accomplish their foreign policy objectives only through 
diplomacy or dialogue and negotiations. The foreign relationships conducted 
between or among states can go beyond diplomatic deal and finally lead to conflicts. 
This means that; states use this instrument when their national interests are not 
fulfilled by peaceful methods. During this time, states use military interventions as 
the last resort. In order to realize foreign policy through military power, the strength 
of  a particular state matters, because states with highly advanced and latest military 
technologies, for instance  USA, Russia, China and others have a great bargaining 
power over other states in the international arena. This foreign policy instrument 
is more of violent and follows imposition of force on other countries. Thus, as 
mentioned above, a country’s strong military and self-defense mechanism further 
strengthens its foreign policy.166

Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbook8.3.1.      The roles of foreign policy in enhancing the 
regional cooperation
As it is discussed above, no state survives without some relationships with other 
states. The same is true in the case of East African region. East Africa, particularly 
the Horn of Africa has been known for its recurrent civil wars and border disputes 
in its history. However, this does not mean that the East African states do not have 
foreign relationships with one another. Rather, states in the Horn of Africa such as 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda have 
a long standing links with each other in areas of language, culture, history, natural 
resources, and so on.
In addition to this, there are cross Boundary Rivers that connect Ethiopia with its 
neighboring states.  Such rivers can determine a special type of relation between the 
countries that these rivers cross. The Blue Nile, Tekeze, Aqobo and Baro flow to 
Sudan and Egypt. Wabishebelle, Genale and Dawa rivers flow to Somalia and Omo 
River flows to Kenya. These rivers have significant contributions in the development 
endeavors of all states and  their fair utilization is a great security concern among 
them. For instance, there has been a serious disagreement between Ethiopia, Sudan 
and Egypt on the construction of Grand Renaissance Dam by Ethiopia on Abay 
River. Thus, these countries will have to negotiate and make agreements in how to 
use these rivers equitably. On the other hand, Ethiopia is the largest country without 
port in the Horn of Africa. As a result, needs to create strong regional cooperation 
with neighboring states by formulating appropriate foreign policies. One of the key 
regional institution through which Ethiopia realizes its regional foreign policy is  
Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD). This regional organization 
is very important to promote peace and security through economic integration in 
East Africa.
Generally, regional cooperation has great impacts in the daily life of the people. It 
helps to solve cross- border disputes among states and speed up socio-economic 
transformations of states. Accordingly, Ethiopia has to look regional foreign policy 
as a podium to realize its two major national interests. The first one is ensuring peace 
and security, whereas the second one is socio-economic transformations.169

8.3.2.      The roles of foreign policy for sustainable peace of 
Ethiopia
A country that is not peaceful domestically cannot enjoy peace with its neighbors. 
Peace and security as one of core components of national interests of sate is a prior-
condition of the national development and regional integration. For a long time East 
Africa, particularly the Horn of Africa has witnessed civil wars between states and 
also terrorist attacks by Al-Shabaab.  
Ethiopia is referred to be a regional power in the Horn of Africa, owing to its military 
and diplomatic clout as well as its population size.  Ethiopia’s growing involvement 
in regional peace and security concerns demonstrates the country’s determination 
to lead and influence the area. Ethiopia’s strategic location in the Horn of Africa, as 
well as the fact that it has porous borders, with some of its neighbors, particularly 
Sudan and Eritrea expose it to disputes or wars in the region.
Furthermore, Ethiopia has committed soldiers to peacekeeping missions in the Horn 
of Africa and other African states to maintain the peace and security of the region. 
For instance, Ethiopia sent its peace keeping forces under  United Nations Interim 
170
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookSecurity  Force      to Somalia, Darfur in Western Sudan and Abyei a hostile border 
region  between Sudan and South Sudan. The country is also significantly involved 
in the African Union- mediated peace process between South Sudan and Sudan, 
which resulted in the signing of a treaty in Addis Ababa on September 27, 2012. 
So, Ethiopia’s role to reducing tensions between the two Sudans is considered as a 
positive step forward.
Generally, Ethiopia needs to focus on its peace and security challenges so that it can 
also have peaceful relations with other countries. Similarly, for the establishment of 
a peaceful, integrated and prosperous region, Ethiopia needs to focus equally on the 
necessity of its neighbors to enjoy domestic peace and stability .

8.3.3.      The roles of foreign policy for socio-economic 
development of Ethiopia
As discussed above one of any state’s primary foreign policy objectives is 
socioeconomic development. East African states are the least developed in terms of 
economic development, and thus cannot be sources of investment or development 
funding. Except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda, all of these countries 
have ports. The provision of port services benefits both the service supplier and the 
service recipient. In fact, if Ethiopia’s neighbors do not supply port services, the 
economic consequences will be severe. As a result, from an economic and mutual 
benefit standpoint, port services would be supplied consistently and predictably .
171
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookEthiopia’s foreign policy with Djibouti, for example, port use is the bedrock of 
the relationship. The port was designed from the start to serve Ethiopia, given its 
proximity to the majority of our country’s regions. In comparison to Ethiopia’s other 
neighbors, Djibouti would profit the most from port services. It also is a country that 
does not have any negative legacy linked to Ethiopia. For all these reasons, Djibouti 
is well placed to be the principal port of use. Although our use of other ports is 
to be expected, the relationship with Djibouti is highly valued as it relates to the 
development of Ethiopia.
From Djibouti’s standpoint, delivering port services is economically significant in 
and of itself, as the port is the country’s primary source of revenue.
As Ethiopia grows, more commodities will certainly pass through the port, and 
Djibouti will profit from the revenue generated by port services. Furthermore, 
Ethiopia has the potential to become a major market for Djibouti, as well as a provider 
of electricity and other essential services. As a result, it is apparent that Ethiopia can 
play an important role in Djibouti’s economic interests and development.

Ethiopia also saves millions of dollars each year by importing oil from neighboring 
Sudan. Ethiopia’s large cost of oil imports has been reduced because to Sudan’s 
shipment of petroleum products to the countries of Horn of Africa. Ethiopia spends 
172
Citizenship Education Grade 9 Student Textbookmore than half of its entire export profits on fuel to meet the country’s need, and 
Sudan has emerged as the primary supply. Ethiopia and Sudan have a long history 
of relationships and agreements on the areas of economics, social, culture, politics, 
education, security and health. The two countries have also long time foreign relations 
in order to strengthen people-to-people ties particularly by bringing the two peoples 
living along the common border closer together, and to encourage trans-border trade 
beyond their formal trade. Sudan imports agricultural products and livestock from 
Ethiopia, making it one of the biggest importing countries of Ethiopian products.
Ethiopia also exports hydroelectric power to some of the Horn African states such as 
Kenya, Sudan and Djibouti. The regional power pool intends to raise country’s export 
profits while also boosting economic growth in electricity-importing countries. 
Generally, Ethiopian has been playing a great role in promoting the economic 
cooperation in the region through its foreign policy. The role of the Ethiopian Grand 
Renascence Dam in terms of fostering region integrating is  also so vital.
