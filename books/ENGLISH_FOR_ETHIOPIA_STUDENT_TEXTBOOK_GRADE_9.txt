Introduction
The English language in Ethiopia serves more as the medium of 
instruction in schools and universities. It plays a significant role in 
students’ academic life. The grade 9 English Textbook is developed 
to satisfy the students’ English language needs at the level and to 
serve them as a backdrop for their future academic career as they 
use the language for academic purposes. The minimum learning 
competencies (MLCs) expected of students are indicated in the 
Grade 9 English language Syllabus, and therefore, the language 
input as well as activities they perform are developed based on the 
MLC identified by the syllabus designers. The learning outcomes 
expected of students are built upon the MLC and constitute 
listening to a variety of texts at different levels (surface and 
deeper levels), interacting in English, reading and comprehending, 
analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating and interpreting ideas vis-
à-vis their environment, getting meanings of words through 
different strategies, and mastery of selected grammatical elements 
appropriate to the level. The outcomes also embrace students’ 
development of sentence, paragraph and essay levels writing. The 
students are expected to write accurate sentences, paragraphs, and 
essays with some level of fluency as they should balance accuracy 
and fluency in their use of the language.
[The ten-unit English Language textbook for Grade 9 has specific 
unit objectives. Each of the units consists of six different parts: 
Listening Skills, Reading Skills, V ocabulary, Grammar, Speaking 
Skills, and Writing Skills organized in that order. The textbook is 
organized by placing the receptive skills before the productive skills, 
because it is presumed that the receptive skills as pre-requisites 
provide students with language inputs which are relevant to their 
language production. Grade 9 English Textbookviii 
The listening skills will be taught based on areas which are national 
and/ or international concerns, focusing more on national issues. 
The listening texts include topics such as urban life versus rural life, 
study skills, road accidents, Gambella national park, diversifying 
export earners through competition, poverty in Ethiopia, community 
services, infectious diseases, cultural diversity, human rights and 
democratic governance, and the concept of the internet. In these 
diversified areas students will listen to various  
texts, and they will develop their listening ability, get ideas about 
the issues they are 
introduced with, relate the ideas with their previous knowledge, 
and analyze, synthesize, 
evaluate  and  interpretthe  ideas  with  the  environment  they  are  
living  in. Students also learn vocabularies, and extend the ideas in 
the listening texts to their speaking and writing development.The 
main purposes of the lessons students learn can generally be two-
fold: students’ language skill development and their achievement 
of the expected competencies.
The reading passages are selected from different sources and they 
focus on life in a big city, learning strategies, traffic accidents, 
national park in Ethiopia, health benefits of gardening, the impact 
of poverty, HIV/ AIDS, equality, equity and justice, and role of 
computers and internet in our lives. Students are required to 
understand the meanings of the reading texts deeply making 
interactions with the authors’ thoughts and their experiences. 
Similar to the activities in the listening texts, vocabularies derived 
from the reading texts, extended speaking and writing activities are 
also included in the reading parts.  
The vocabulary lessons constitute vocabulary from the listening 
and reading texts, phrasal verbs and word formation using affixes 
(prefixes and suffixes).  The vocabulary is taught through the Grade 9 English Textbook ix 
application of contextual understanding of meanings, consulting 
the dictionary and using other strategies. In teaching vocabulary, 
we focus more on the strategies students may employ to understand 
meanings by themselves. We believe the students should have this 
skill because vocabulary is important for them to develop their 
reading and listening comprehension,   speaking, writing, spelling, 
and others. In brief, it is important for their English language 
development, communicating ideas, expressing their ideas in 
speaking and writing.
Concerning the grammar lessons, brief notes and many activities are 
provided for the students tohelp them master the grammar elements 
in focus. Many of the grammar lessons are presented in situations 
students can easily understand and apply: they are developed in 
simpler ways to enable the students to express even complex ideas.
In other words , the grammar lessons are taught the way they help 
students effectively talk in the language. The grammar elements 
are taught linearly or cyclically. Some of the elements such as 
‘adverbs of frequency’, ‘conditional sentences’, and ‘tenses’ appear 
cyclically, while the rest of the grammar elements appear only once 
in the textbook. The speaking and writing sections derive from the 
listening and reading activities, and other areas which are assumed 
to be important to deal with.
Dear students!
In the Textbook, there are a number of activities in each unit and 
section of the unit. You need to do all the activities; it is only when 
you do the activities that you can develop your English language 
competence. So, we earnestly advise you to be engaged in doing the 
activities. You may make mistakes when you do the activities, but 
it doesn’t matter you can learn the correct forms from your friends 
or from your teacher. If you find some of the activitiesdifficult, the Grade 9 English Textbookx 
solution is, you discuss them with your partner or in groups. You 
can also request your teacher for explanation so that the teacher can 
assist you individually, with your group or with your classmates as 
a whole. Grade 9 English Textbook 1

 ʯActivity 1.6 Read the passage carefully and 
decide whether each statement 
given below is ‘true’ or ‘false’.
Life in a Big City
1. A big city has a lot on offer for you to make your life a  
pleasant  experience. However, as you know, good things 
never come easy to  reap  the perks of city life; you have to 
make sure to work hard at the same pace as it runs . Hence, 
people work like a machine to fulfill their dreams and be 
successful.Grade 9 English Textbook 5 §Reading  Skills

2. Moreover, people experience a lot of competition in big 
cities to achieve their life’s goal. Whether a business owner 
or an employee both struggle to be at par and earn more 
fame as well as money. They all have to match the pace of 
life to make the ends meet. A good life in a big city is almost 
impossible unless you are well settled . Also, you will hardly 
get any free and peaceful time in such cities as you have to 
hustle  consistently.
3. You will see there is a great rush of traffic at peak hours of 
the morning as well as evening. It is not easy to shop around 
in the markets because they are bustling  with the crowd 
always. The parks are full, and the metro is congested. These 
thickly populated cities even go through housing problems, 
which is even increasing every passing day. All this seldom 
gives the residents of the big city any peaceful moment.
4. Furthermore, essentials are so expensive that the middle-
class families also lead a miserable life. Due to a high rate 
of population, demand for resources arises. As a result, you 
will find every product adulterated, ranging from milk, 
ghee, and oil to pulses. Pollution is another harsh reality 
of metropolitan cities. Air and water both are impur e that 
create an unhealthy living environment.
5. On the contrary, life in a big city is a comfortable and 
convenient choice too. It is a place for luxury abundant 
of technology, entertainment, job opportunities, advanced 
education, and medical facilities. Undoubtedly, a big city 
is the best place to reside if your pockets are full of money.Grade 9 English Textbook6 §Reading  Skills

6. There are oodles  of recreational activities available in metro 
cities like gardens, amusement parks, restaurants, or clubs. 
You can hang out there with your family or friends. You 
will celebrate festivals here with more pomp and show. 
Additionally, there are fewer social issues when you live in 
big cities than in villages or small towns.
7. You can have an enjoyable yet stressful life here. The metro 
city will present you with many struggles, but you can’t 
give up on them to live a happy and successful life. Thus, 
all you need is a thought and effort to live a balanced life for 
creating a sustainable living space.
8. Make sure to never give up. Moreover, make the right 
choices, have an organized life in which you don’t hurt 
nature. Also, take out some time for your loved ones to 
maintain the relationship. After all, you are working hard 
to live a satisfying life with them not to get detached from 
them. Indeed you have to work hard for better living in a big 
city but without losing other precious  things in life.
    Now, write ‘true’ or ‘false’ for each of the statments below.
1. City life gives opportunities for a better life.
2. People must work hard to benefit in cities.
3. City life will be preferred if you have sufficient money to 
spend.
4. There are more social issues in cities than in villages.
5. According to the passage, city life requires more hard 
work.
6. Living in a city could not only be enjoyable but also 
stressful.Grade 9 English Textbook 7 §Reading  Skills

life difficult.
10. In a city, people need to cooperate for creating peaceful 
living condition.

 1.3.2 Phrasal verbs
A phrasal verb is a phrase which is made up of a verb and usually 
a preposition  or an adverb . The meaning of the verb usually changes

1.4 Grammar
In this Unit, you will learn about multiple grammar elements: tag 
questions, simple present, present continuous tenses, wh-questions 
using simple present and present continuous tenses, yes/no 
questions, and questions with auxiliary verbs. You will learn each 
of them. Now let’s begin with tag questions.
 1.4.1 Tag questions
Do you know what tag questions are? Look at the following 
sentences, and try to see how the questions are developed.
Examples: 
 1 We love our country, don’t we ?
 2 Ethiopia is not in Asia, is it?
What did you observe in these sentences? The parts of the sentences 
‘don’t we?’ and ‘is it? are tag questions. Guess how they are 
formed. As you see, for the positive statement, you have a negative 
tag question; and for the negative statement, the tag question is 
positive type. 
 ʯActivity 1.11 Give tag questions for the 
following statements.
1. You are a student, ______________?
2. She doesn’t like chewing ‘chat’,  ______________?
3. It isn’t raining,  ______________?
4. They have done their homework,  ______________?
5. Our teacher is always punctual, ______________?
6. He lives in a big city, ______________?
7. Living in rural areas is interesting,  ______________?
8. I am a student,___________?Grade 9 English Textbook12 §Grammar

 ʯActivity 1.12 Now read the following 
paragraph and underline the 
tag questions. Check whether 
or not you have underlined the 
correct tag questions with your 
partner.
Daniel is sitting alone in the field. He looks around and speaks to 
himself. “Birds are free, aren’t they? They can fly at large, can’t 
they? They are not the best of creations like man, are they? Man 
is the best creation of God, isn’t he? He cannot fly in the sky, can 
he? Birds are a part of our environment. But they do not pollute 
our environment, do they? It is man who pollutes his environment, 
doesn’t he? We should not pollute our environment, should we? 
Our people are not educated. If they are educated they will become 
conscious, won’t they? Our people must be educated, mustn’t they? 
Oh! The sun is already set. I am late for home, aren’t I? I have to 
return now, haven’t I?
Take the following sentences and the tag questions as examples.
 1 Birds are free , aren’t they?
 2 He cannot fly in the sky,  can he?
 3 They do not pollute our environment,  do they?
 4 It is man who pollutes the environment , isn’t he?
 5 Our people must be educated,  mustn’t they?
 6 I have to return now,  haven’t I?
 7 I am late for home,  aren’t I?
The italicized parts of the sentences are tag questions. They are 
formed by using the auxiliary verbs used in the first part of the 
sentence. The only exception is with sentence number 7. What is it? Grade 9 English Textbook 13 §Grammar
u
n
i
t

Unlike the other statements that repeat the verbs in tag questions, 
the statement that has the verb ‘am’ will have the tag question as 
‘aren’t I’?
I am late for home,  aren’t I?butI am not late,  am I?
I am a student , aren’t I? I am not a student , am I? 
 Another important point you have to note is the positive and negative 
tags. For positive statements, you will have negative tags. The sentences 
‘Birds are free, aren’t they?’ and ‘Our people must be educated, mustn’t 
they?’ are good examples. When the sentences are negative, however, you 
will have positive tags. The sentences ‘He cannot fly in the sky, can he?’ 
and ‘They do not pollute our environment, do they?’ are good examples. 
 ʯActivity 1.13 Complete the missing parts of 
the statements by adding tag 
questions.
1. You would like to come with us,  ______________?
2. The club members played well, ______________?
3. Our father will not be with us next week,  ____________?
4. They weren’t part of the regular team, ______________?
5. The weather is really good today, ______________?
6. I shouldn’t criticize my teacher,  ______________?
7. I have to behave good,  ______________?

Present Tense

present verbs.Grade 9 English Textbook14 §Grammar

Paragraph 
Most people don’t like bugs, but Doctor Aster loves  them! In 
fact, her nickname is Doctor Bugs. She’s a photographer and 
an entomologist. An entomologist studies bugs. Doctor Aster’s 
favorite bug is the ant. She goes all over the world to study ants. 
She watches them as they eat, work, rest, sleep, and fight. She takes 
photographs of the ants. She lies on the ground with her camera 
and waits for the right moment. The ants and other bugs often bite 
her, but that doesn’t stop Doctor Bugs. She has an interesting and 
unusual job, and she loves it!
The forms of the simple present tense
Singular subjects like he, she, it, the student, Abebe, etc. will add 
‘–s’ or ‘ –es’ to form the simple present tense, while plural subjects 
will have the infinitive forms of the verbs. Look at the forms in 
the Table below. The negative forms of the simple present tense 
are developed using the verbs ‘ does+ not +the infinitive ’ for the 
singular subjects and ‘ do+ not +the infinitive ’ for plural subjects. 
‘I’ as a subject takes the same forms of verbs as plural subjects. In 
examples given in the table, the negative marker ‘ not’ is contracted 
as ‘n’t’ (e.g. do not = don’t ; and does not = doesn’t ). Look at 
the examples given in the Table carefully, and discuss in groups 
how the positive, negative and question forms of the simple present 
tense are formed.Grade 9 English Textbook 15 §Grammar

 Note
The simple present tense has different functions. It expresses, for 
example, habitual actions, future actions and other functions. In 
this Unit, you learn how it can be used to express habitual actions 
and future actions. When it expresses habitual actions, it is used 
with words like  everyday,  always, sometimes, often, etc which are 
called ‘adverbs of frequency’.  You will learn about the ‘adverbs of 
frequency’ in units 2 and 3, and we advise you to refer back to this Grade 9 English Textbook16 §Grammar

 1.4.3 The Present Continuous Tense
The present continuous tense is formed by the use of ‘is’, ‘am’, and 
‘are’ as helping verbs and the –ing forms of the main verbs. How are 
‘is’, ‘am’ and ‘are’ used? ‘Is’ is used with singular subjects, while 
‘are’ is used with plural subjects. ‘Am’ is used with the subject ‘I’.

discuss in groups how the positive, negative and question forms of 
the present continuous tense are formed.

based on your personal 
experience and the information 
you get from the above picture. 
Share your answers with your 
group members.
1. In pairs, discuss what clever students usually do for their 
learning.
    Begin your discussion as:  They plan their time and use it effectively...
2. How do you learn English?
    Begin your discussion as: I learn English by referring to dictionaries 
for new words...
3.  Do you know the meanings of the words below?
strategy     plan       manage          style               goal      
Learning strategies
1. Learning strategies or study skills determine your approach 
to achieve your learning objectives. They are plans that 
learners consciously have recourse to in order to help them 
learn more effectively. These strategies are usually linked 
to learners’ needs and interests to boost learning. They are 
grounded on various types of learning styles. There are some 
strategies that can help you be successful in your studies.
2. First set small, achievable goals. Start with small steps to 
reach higher targets. For example, try to learn 5 new English 
vocabulary items every day, set a 30 minutes study session 
every day, learn the lyrics of an English song every now 
and then, and read a short English text every day. Therefore, Grade 9 English Textbook36 § Reading Skills
u
n

t

setting small targets is much better than setting huge goals 
that you cannot achieve. Remember that “small drops of 
water make the mighty ocean”.
3. Secondly, plan your studies. Planning your studies gives 
meaning to your work. If you know all the steps necessary 
to achieve a goal and these steps are written down on a piece 
of paper, it will be easy for you to see the whole picture.
4. Thirdly, be motivated. The secret to success is that you 
should be motivated to learn. Try to avoid boredom by 
having fun in what you do. Try to find a positive aspect to 
studying English. That is, read about what you are interested 
in (hobbies, fields of interest...), watch your favourite films 
in English, listen to your favourite English songs and learn 
the lyrics . Write your diary in English and read about your 
favorite stars in magazines or online. Remember, we learn 
better and fast things we really want to learn.
5. Fourthly, manage your time. In order to manage your time 
successfully, having an awareness of what your goals are will 
assist you in prioritizing your activities. Time management 
provides you with the opportunity to create a schedule that 
works for you, not for others. This  personal touch gives you 
the flexibility to include the things that are most important 
to you.
6. Finally, set a reward for yourself. Set a reward for yourself 
that you can look forward to. For example, when you reach a 
goal, give yourself a reward: watch a movie, have a delicious 
snack, meet your friends, and go to the café.Grade 9 English Textbook 37 § Reading Skills

7. Generally, your learning achievement will definitely be 
met given that you set your manageable goals, plan your 
studies properly, arouse your interest of learning, manage 
your time effectively and get a reward for yourself when 
you accomplish   the learning activities successfully.

2.4 Grammar
 2.4.1 Connectors: addition markers
Connectors create coherence in a paragraph making words, phrases, 
and sentences logically interweave among each other. If sentences 
are unified, they will have a logical order and they will be easy for 
listeners and readers to grasp meanings. Grade 9 English Textbook42 §Grammar
u
n
i
t
2
There are different types of connectors. Some of them indicate 
contrasts; others show cause and effect, and still others indicate 
addition. There are also connectors that show comparison, time 
order, examples, generalization, summary, etc. Connectors serve 
as transition words and connect ideas of a sentence to another and 
even paragraphs. In this Unit you will learn about addition and 
time order connectors. The addition connectors (markers)  
include and, also, besides, further, furthermore, too, moreover, 
in addition, then, of equal importance, equally important, and 
another; while the time order (sequence) connectors include 
words like at first, eventually, finally, first, firstly, in the end, 
in the first place, in the second place, lastly, later, next, second, 
secondly, to begin with . Which one (s) of these are you familiar 
with? 
How are and, also, besides, further, furthermore, too, moreover, etc. 
used in sentences? 
Examples
 1 Reading books helps to learn new information; furthermore, it 
helps one to keep his or her brain fresh.

 2.4.3 Adverbs of frequency
Do you know words like always, often, usually, sometimes, rarely, 
etc.? People usually use them in their speaking and writing. You 
need to lean them very well because you will use them when 
you speak and write in English. We hope you remember that we 
mentioned the ‘adverbs of frequency’ that they will be used with 
simple present tenses in indicating habitual actions.Grade 9 English Textbook 45 §Grammar

 ʯActivity 2.13 Read the following two short 
dialogues and pay attention to 
the words in bold. What do you 
think they tell us?
Dialogue 1
Tesfaye: What kind of person are you?
Shemsu: Well, I’m friendly and outgoing, and I’m usually  very 
happy. I don’t often complain, and I never  shout or get 
really angry. How about you?
Tesfaye: I’m friendly too, and I’m a little shy.
Shemsu: I’m always  happy, but sometimes  I’m very busy. I always  
try to have a happy face.
Tesfaye:    Me too!
Dialogue 2
Tinsae: What are some customs in your country, Ethiopia?
Kassahun: We always  bow to people we meet, and we never  joke 
about people’ s names.
Tinsae: That’s good. Here we never ask about people’s salary, 
it’s rude. Also we usually aren’t late for meetings.
Kassahun:  That’s good too!
 Note
The words always, usually, often, occasionally, seldom, 
sometimes, rarely and never which are written in bold in the 
dialogues above are called ‘frequency adverbs’. They describe how 
often an action happens.

 5 Few students rarely  go to the cinema in the summer. because they 
prefer to stay outside.
 6 As students are so busy, they never  go to bed before 10 o’clock.
 7 Sometimes  she does her homework with friends.
 8 Usually  they study on their own. 
 9 Students should usually  try to get meanings of words from contexts 
they are used.
The adverbs of frequency can also be used after the modal verbs as in the 
following examples.
 Examples
 1 You must always try  your best.
 2 We can usually find  a seat on our train.
 3 We should not always  depend on dictionaries to for meanings of 
words.
 4 They should never be  rude to customers.  
To make questions about frequency, we can use ‘how often…?’ and using 
the ‘do verbs. 
Examples 
 1 How often  do you watch films?
 2 How often  does he play tennis?
 3 How often  do the trains arrive late?
 4 Do you often  come here?

It was just before midnight on October 31st last year. Susan Lee 
was driving  home after visiting her sister. The road was clear and 
she was driving carefully. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a young 
man stepped  out in front of her. He was wearing a dark coloured 
raincoat and carrying a backpack. Susan stepped hard on the brake 
pedal but it was too late. She got out of the car but, to her surprise, 
there was nobody there. While she was looking under the car, she 
felt a cold wind on her face and a strange presence that sent shivers 
down her spine. She was still looking under her car when a lorry 
behind her. The lorry driver, a middle-aged man, walked  up to her 
and asked her if she needed help to start her car so she told him 
what had happened. He seems surprised when Susan told him about Grade 9 English Textbook48 §Grammar

 2.6.1 Sentence level writing
 ʯActivity 2.24 Based on the explanations and 
examples given about compound 
and complex sentences in the 
Box below, give answers to the 
questions using compound or 
complex sentences. The first 
question is done for you as an 
example.
 Note:
Compound and complex sentences
1. Compound sentences are formed by combining two or more 
sentences which are all independent clauses. They are formed by the 
coordinating conjunctions such as but, and, or, etc.
For example,
She worked hard  and she scored good marks.
As you see in the example, both clauses that are combined by 
‘and’ are independent clauses; so such kind of sentences is called 
compound sentences.
2. Complex sentences are sentences that contain one or more 
independent clauses and one dependent clause in a sentence.
For example,  
When she was in primary school , she used to study hard.
             In the example above, the first part of the sentence is a subordinate 
(dependent) clause, while the second part of the sentence is a main 
(independent) clause. Such kind of sentences is called complex 
sentences . Grade 9 English Textbook58 § Writing Skills

Punctuation Tips
Period (.):  The ‘period’ is used at the end of a sentence.
Comma(,):  There are different functions of the comma( ,). Some of its 
uses include the following.
a) to separate words in a series.
 Exampple:  The student is intellegent,hard-working and duty-mineded.
b) when the subordinate clause appears before the main clause in a 
sentence.
   Example:  When I was a child, I used to play hide -and-seek.
Qestion mark(?):  We use question mark at the end of a direct question.
        Example : Do you like the English lesson?
Semi-colon(;) : We use semi-colon to join related independant clauses 
with connecting words.
      Example:  When I finish here, I will be glad to help you; and that is a  
                        promise I will keep.

Traffic Accidents
1. Every day in the newspaper, we read about road accidents 
where people get severely injured and even die. You may 
have also been in an accident yourself or witnessed one 
happening. Many of us may even have seen crowding  on the 
street around two vehicles that look crushed. Road accidents Grade 9 English Textbook64 § Reading Skills

are not uncommon in big cities where there are thousands of 
cars, motorcycles, auto-rickshaws, trucks, buses, and other 
vehicles. Road accidents are most often the result of people 
breaking traffic rules.
2. There is a reason that traffic rules are created in the first 
place. However, people break them all the time, especially 
when they know that the police don’t always catch them for 
doing it. While the people who break the rules and get away 
with it are lucky not to get caught, they are endangering  
their lives whenever they indulge  in such misbehavior. 
The penalty for breaking traffic rules is generally fine, 
but worse consequences of this are injuries like paralysis, 
broken bones, concussions, etc. The worst possible outcome  
of breaking traffic rules and getting into a road accident is 
death.
3. The traffic rule that people break the most is jumping red 
lights, which means they keep driving even when the signal 
is red. Another bad habit that causes road accidents is drunk 
driving. What they  don’t realize is that when the light is 
red for them, it is green for someone else and that they are 
putting their lives in danger because of this.  Most of the 
time, people take turns on the road without putting on their 
indicator to do so, and this can lead to road accidents too. 
Thus, breaking traffic rules is very harmful, and people 
should refrain  from doing so not only out of fear of the 
police but also because it risks their lives.
4. Road accidents are very scary , so we must ensure the utmost 
safety while driving. One must always wear their seat belt, 
only drive when the signal is green, stick to the speed limit, 
stay in your own lane, wear helmets when riding bikes, Grade 9 English Textbook 65 § Reading Skills

etc. The best way to prevent getting in a road accident is to 
ensure that you are following all the rules required to keep 
you safe. After all, we only have one life, and it is important 
to take care of it so we can enjoy it to the fullest.

indicator to do so.

do the same thing every day?
Reporter: No, not really. I rarely do the same thing from one day to 
the next.
Student:  Could you explain that a little bit more?
Reporter: Well, I mean that I always have a story that I’m working 
on, but the stories are always different, so I never see 
the same people. I visit different people, go to different

Reporter: Oh, I always take my cell phone with me.
Student: Do you usually have a laptop with you, too?
Reporter: No. I don’t like to use laptop when I am interviewing’. I 
sometimes take notes on paper, but I usually use a little 
voice recorder. Then I type my stories as soon as I get 
back to the office.
Student: So you don’t use email much.

lunch, and morning, again when I get to the office, 
before and after lunch, and again before I go home in 
the evening.

Writing informal letters
Letter writing is an important skill you should develop. Written 
communication in both formal  and personal matters is crucial and 
so it is necessary to develop a skill for letter writing. Here, we will 
focus on how to write informal letters.
Informal letters are written to close acquaintances of the writer such 
as friends, family and relatives. They are also written in informal 
and person tone with no set format. However, there is a general 
pattern (format) given below.
Format of Informal Letter 
1. Sender’s Address 
2. Date (e.g. 25 April 2020) 
3. Salutation (e.g. Dear Mom)

Dear Marta,
I hope this letter finds you well and holds up over your mother’s death of a 
traffic accident. I know what a difficult time it is for you.
I think that when God created mothers as the very special people that they 
are.  He had your mom in mind already. She was truly one of those blessed 
and good people who are full of so much grace and dignity.
I know your faith will comfort you. My prayers will be for you and your 
family to find the peace and strength that comes in knowing that a loved 
one has gone to their eternal rest.
God Bless You.

Dear Feysa
I am so sorry to read your devastating news. I never met your Dad, but 
know how wonderful and supportive he was to you over the years and can 
only start to imagine what you are feeling now.
You will gradually find comfort in all the happy memories. Your parents 
found their new life in Australia and lived the last years of thier life in 
contentment there, surrounded by family.
Your dad lived to see you find happiness and security and love. He will 
have died content for knowing that. AND best of all he did not suffer a 
long illness.
Make sure you find time to grieve and allow yourself to do so – and don’t 
expect it to pass quickly. Losing a parent takes time to process for us 
mortals. Do you remember I was in the aftermath of losing my dad when 
we first became close? I didn’t fully recover from that for at least two 
years – and made some very strange decisions and acted out of character 
for much of that time.
I wish I could be with you to try to help somehow. I’m giving you a big hug 
now from halfway across the globe.
Sending love to you and all your family.
Take care and hang on in there.

I hope this letter finds you in the best of spirits. When I visited last week,

Come on boy, you should thank God for giving you a fresh lease of life. 
Everything is going to be fine very soon. I even talked to your doctor this

You will have to remain in the hospital for a few more days but that is not 
something you should be concerned about. Your family and friends are 
there for you.
Don’t forget that life is a mixture of joys and sorrows. By the way, all of 
us have decided to celebrate your recovery as soon as you come home. 
You will be throwing a party the day you come back home from the

4.4 Grammar: 
Zero Conditional and First 
Conditional Sentences
Did you learn about the conditional sentences before? It does 
not matter if you haven’t been introduced with them. You know, 
conditional sentences show possible outcomes in certain conditions. 
Conditional sentences are also usually called ‘if-clauses’. The 
clause that begins with ‘if’ introduces a condition that may or may 
not happen depending on circumstances. In other words, the event 
described in the main clause depends on the condition described in 
the conditional clause. 
Examples
 1 If it is cold, I put on  a coat.
 2 We will stay  at home if it snows.
 3 We would stay  at home if it snowed .
 4 If I were you  I would accept the offer.
 5 If you hadn’t been late  for work, the boss wouldn’t have gotten  
furious.
In all the examples above, ‘I put on a coat, we will stay home, 
we would stay at home’, and ‘the boss wouldn’t stay at home’ can 
happen based on the condition in the ‘if clauses’ ‘if it is cold’, ‘if it Grade 9 English Textbook98 §Grammar: 
u
n
i
t
4
snows’, ‘if it snowed’, ‘if I were you’, and ‘if you hadn’t been late 
for work’.
Each of the above conditional sentences represents different 
conditional types, the first one being the zero conditional. The 
conditional sentences vary from probable to impossible meanings. 
Sentences 3-5 are classified under conditionals type 2 and 3; and 
you will study them in Unit 5. In this Unit, however, you will 
learn about the zero conditionals and conditional type 1 which 
are similar to examples 1 and 2 above. The zero conditionals are 
also called facts, while conditional type 1 is probable. Read the 
following additional examples and see how the verb tenses in the 
two parts of the sentence (main clause and if-clause) in the zero 
conditional are used.
 4.4.1 The zero conditional
Examples
 1 If I drink  coffee, I get a headache. OR I get a headache, if I  drink 
coffee.
 2 The door opens  if you press  this button. OR If you press  this button, 
the door opens.
 3 If it doesn’t rain , the flowers die. OR The flowers die if it doesn’t 
rain.
 4 If you boil water to 100 o c at sea level, it changes  to steam. OR 
Water changes  to steam if you boil it  to 100 o c at sea level. 
Have you noticed the verb tenses used in the main and subordinate 
clauses, and how the sentence parts are placed in the sentences? 
The verb tense used in both parts of the sentence ( drink and get; 
opens and press; doesn’t rain and die;  and boil and changes ) is 
simple present tense. As you see from the examples, each of the 
sentences can be spoken or written by using the subordinate or 
the main clause at the beginning of the sentence. What about the Grade 9 English Textbook 99 §Grammar:  
u
n
i
t
4
meaning? In all the sentences, the meanings indicate a fact that the 
fulfillment of the actions in the subordinate clauses (if-clauses) is 
a condition for the fulfillment of the actions in the main clauses. If 
you take the final statement as an example, ‘ If you boil water to 100 
o c at sea level, it changes  to steam’ , it is true to anyone anywhere 
that if one boils water to 100 o c at sea level, it changes to another 
state; that is steam. Discuss with your partner about the meanings 
of the other sentences in the examples. Discuss also about how you 
can use the comma in the sentences.

sentences based on the given 
incomplete sentence parts in 
brackets. The first two are done 
for you as an examples.

 Health Benefits of Gardening
1. The act of gardening goes back to thousands of years. If 
gardens are beautiful to look at, imagine the pride and sense 
of accomplishment that the creator of such beauty can feel.
2. Numerous studies have been undertaken which show that 
gardening offers many health related benefits. The most 
obvious benefit of gardening is that it can be a great way 
to relieve stress. Work, family commitments, and social Grade 9 English Textbook110 § Reading Skills
u
n
i
t
engagements are just some of the things that take up chunks 
of peoples’ lives. Planting the garden and then caring for the 
garden offers the gardener a simple and inexpensive way 
to unwind  and relax. Gardening can help a person clear the 
mind.
3. Another health related benefit of gardening is that when 
people do their gardens, they are getting exercise. Even 
an activity as simple as gardening can contribute  towards 
weight loss. Gardening gets a person outdoors, exposed to 
natural air, and refocused on a pleasant activity.
4. Gardening also offers nutritional benefits to those who 
choose to plant a vegetable garden. Creating a vegetable 
garden is a way of ensuring that there is a continuous 
supply of fresh vegetables to consume . Vegetable gardeners 
know exactly where their produce is coming from and they 
also know exactly what chemicals were used to grow the 
produce. Eating more vegetables, and especially home-
grown vegetables, is a simple way to ensure that a body is 
getting a proper balance of vitamins and nutrients.
5. And finally, some studies even report that people who are 
exposed to gardens and gardening recover more quickly 
from illnesses. It seems that for many people, gardening is 
just what the doctor ordered.
6. Gardening can be a creative experience as well. It’s one 
thing to throw some seeds down and then wait to see what 
grows. While gardening does not require that the participant 
have a degree in landscape architecture, a bit of planning 
will go a long way towards enhancing  the beauty and the 
gardening experience overall.Grade 9 English Textbook 111 § Reading Skills
u
n
i
t
7. And finally, the act of gardening teaches people the art of 
being patient. Unlike other activities, gardening does not 
produce instantaneous  results. As such, a person who takes 
up gardening must wait for their rewards. Cut the flowers 
and vegetables, bring them inside and enjoy the sense of 
accomplishment that is gained from the benefit-rich activity 
called gardening!
Adapted from The Fresh Reads: https://www.thefreshreads.com

Second Conditional & Third 
Conditional Sentences
In Unit 4, you were introduced with the zero conditional and 
conditional sentences type I. Do you remember these examples?  
Examples
 1 If it is cold, I put on  a coat.
 2 We will stay  at home if it snows.
What do you call the conditional type in example 1? Yes, we call 
that type the zero conditional that is used to express facts. The 
second sentence shows a probable condition. In this Unit, you will 
learn the different conditional sentences called second conditional  
and third conditional sentences.
Examples
 1 We would stay  at home if it snowed .
 2 If I were you  I would accept  the offer.
 3 If I hadn’t arrived  in time, I wouldn’t have gotten  the bus.
Compare the tense forms and the meanings of these sentences 
with those you studied in Unit 4. A summary note is given to you 
in the Table below.

 5.4.1  Second Conditional Sentences  
Second conditional sentences have the verb forms simple past in the 
if-clause and conditional (would/ should/ could/ might + infinitive) 
in the main clause. Such sentences show possible but very unlikely 
actions to be fulfilled. 
Examples
 1 If I found her address, I would send her an invitation. 
 2 You would pass  the examination if you studied hard.
 ʯActivity 5.8 Complete the Conditional

5. We (help) _______you if we (know) ___________ how. 
6. My brother (buy) ________a sports shoes if he

 5.4.2  Third Conditional Sentences 
A third conditional sentence has past perfect verb form in the if-
clause and would/ could/ should/ might +have+ past participle 
(modal perfect tense) in the main clause.  Such conditional sentences 
indicate that the actions have impossible conditions to be fulfilled. 
They refer to actions that were not completed in the past.Grade 9 English Textbook 115 §Grammar

 ʯActivity 6.5 Now, read the following passage 
and answer the questions that 
follow it.
The Impact of Poverty
1. Not surprisingly, the consequences of poverty are often also 
causes. The poor often experience inadequate healthcare, 
limited education, and the inaccessibility of birth control. But 
those born into these conditions are incredibly challenged 
in their efforts to break out since these consequences of 
poverty are also causes of poverty, perpetuating  a cycle of 
disadvantage.
2. According to sociologists’ analysis of global inequality 
studies, the consequences of poverty are many. They have 
divided them into three areas. The first, termed “these 
dimentation of global inequality,” relates to the fact that 
once poverty becomes entrenched  in an area, it is typically 
very difficult to reverse . As mentioned above, poverty 
exists in a cycle where the consequences and causes are 
intertwined. The second consequence of poverty is its 
effect on physical and mental health. Poor people face 
physical health challenges, including malnutrition and high 
infant mortality rates. Mental health is also detrimentally 
affected by the emotional stresses of poverty, with relative 
deprivation carrying the most robust  effect. Again, as with 
the ongoing inequality, the effects of poverty on mental 
and physical health become more entrenched as time goes 
on. The third consequence of poverty is the prevalence  of 
crime. Cross-nationally, crime rates are higher, particularly Grade 9 English Textbook128 § Reading Skills
u
n

for violent crime, in countries with higher levels of income 
inequality.
3. While most of us are accustomed  to thinking of slavery in 
terms of the antebellum South, modern day slavery goes 
hand-in-hand with global inequality. In short, slavery 
refers to any situation in which people are sold, treated as 
property, or forced to work for little or no pay. Just as in the 
pre-Civil War United States, these humans are at the mercy  
of their employers. Chattel slavery, the form of slavery once 
practiced in the American South, occurs when one person 
owns another as property. Child slavery, which may include 
child prostitution, is a form of chattel slavery. In debt 
bondage, or bonded labor, the poor pledge  themselves as 
servants in exchange for the cost of basic necessities like 
transportation, room, and board. In this scenario, people are 
paid less than they are charged for room and board. When 
travel is required, they can arrive in debt for their travel 
expenses and be unable to work their way free, since their 
wages  do not allow them to ever get ahead.
4. The global watchdog group Anti-Slavery International 
recognizes  other forms of slavery: human trafficking (in 
which people are moved away from their communities and 
forced to work against their will), child domestic work and 
child labor, and certain forms of servile marriage, in which 
women are little more than chattel slaves.
  
Now answer the following questions.
1. How many poverty consequences are discussed in the 
passage? Mention them.

4. According to the passage, differentiate the modern form of 
slavery with the historical one, before the American civil 
war.
5. After reading the passage, what do you feel about poverty? 
Do you think the writer exaggerate or lessen the impact 
of poverty? Discuss with partner and write two or more 
sentences about what the government of Ethiopia and the 
people need to do for alleviating poverty.

 6.3.2 Suffixes  –ate, -ise/ ize, -ment,  and –tion
Affixes which include prefixes and suffixes help develop words. As 
you studied in the previous units, prefixes are word parts that are 
added at the beginnings of the root words to form new words. They 
modify the meanings of the words. Prefixes make words negative, 
indicate opinion or show repetition.
Examples
Unhappy    The word is formed from the root word ‘happy’ and 
the prefix ‘un’; and the meaning of the root word has 
changed from positive to negative because of the prefix.
Disorganized The word is formed from the root word ‘organize’, 
the prefix ‘dis-’   and the suffix ‘-ed’. Similar 
to the above   example, the prefix has   
formed a negative meaning to the word.
Suffixes are word parts that are added at the ends of root words, 
and form new words which can be nouns, verb forms, adjectives 
and adverbs. 
Examples
forgetful The word is formed by adding the suffix ‘ful’ to the root 
word ‘forget’. In this example, we see how the verb 
‘forget’ is changed to an adjective, ‘forgetful’.
happiness The word is formed by adding the suffix ‘ness’ to the 
root word ‘happy’. In this example, we see how the 
adjective ‘happy’ is changed to a noun, ‘happiness’.
In this Unit, you will be introduced with word formation using 
suffixes. You will also be introduced with few phrasal verbs. The 
suffixes you will study are –ate, -ise/ ize, -ment, and –tion. Grade 9 English Textbook 131 § Vocabulary Development

Do you remember the obligation markers you were introduced with 
in Unit 3? Do you remember the modal verbs such as can, could, 
may, might, must, shall , should, ought to,  will,  and would, etc.? 
We hope you remember the example sentences such as:

Now you will learn few modal verbs that help you express 
obligations, prohibitions and absence of obligations. Let’s start 
doing the activity that is based on the dialogue below. 
 ʯActivity 6.10 Read the following dialogue and 
in your group underline verbs 
that indicate prohibition or 
obligation
Prohibition and obligation
Abebe:  Shall we drive to the restaurant?
Husien:  We mustn’t drive in this country unless we are over eighteen. 
So, we cannot drive to the restaurant since both of us are 
only sixteen.
Abebe:  Shall we walk then?
Husien:  No. We mustn’t do that; our class time is approaching. We 
mustn’t miss classes
Abebe:  Shall we go after class? 
Husien:   Yes, if we get enough time, we can go. But, we have to give 
priority to our lessons.
Abebe:   I don’t agree more; we must learn first. 
Husien:   Thank you. Abebe, we don’t have to worry about getting 
leisure time; we have to give time to our homework and 
other activities the teacher gives us. Ok?
Abebe:   Ok. It’s a good idea. 
How many of the verbs did you underline correctly? The modal 
verbs used in the dialogue are must, mustn’t, have to , and don’t 
have to.  The modal verbs have to , must, don’t have to,  and mustn’t 
are common verbs you use to express obligation or prohibition and 
absence of obligation. Have you ever used them while you speak 
and write in English? To learn about the differences among the 
modal verbs, study the short notes given about each of them in the

Bahir Dar and is dedicated  to providing the highest quality

individual regain health and strength while respecting 
individuality, dignity  and autonomy.
2. My duties were taking care of the elderly, answering phones 
with proper greeting, and filing reports and certain patient 
information. From often time to time, they moved me from 
floor to floor where as I dealt with different people every 
day. Every day I came in with a good positive attitude. I 
prepared their meals and gave them their daily supplies.
3. They  also showed me the parts to the hospital, they taught 
me the little things that I can learn how to do now such as, 
Wheel and Lock a Wheelchair, Take Patients in and out of 
there wheelchair, etc. Every day I spent in the hospital I 
learned something new I learned what community service 
really is. I have learned responsibilities that it is not easy to 
do as to what the nurses do on the regular, and trust me their 
job is not easy. I truly now know the value of community 
service, which is providing a service to the community.
4. This type of service gives me a chance to gain working 
experience, so that I can develop and improve on my 
working skills, something I lack. I am also able to build 
on my self-confidence. Community service gives me the 
opportunity to learn more about myself and my abilities. 
Doing community service makes me feel complete  because 
I’m doing something that is meaningful to my community 
where I live. In conclusion, I truly believe that doing 
community service, is not only doing God’s work, but given 
back to the community and helping someone less fortunate  
than me. Working with the elderly, is not easy at all it took 
time and patience. You have to be patient and encourage 
them that there is a way and God can make it happen. I love Grade 9 English Textbook146 § Vocabulary Development

 Note
Relative clauses are formed with the relative pronouns who, that, 
which, whose, where, when, and are most often used to define or 
identify the noun that precedes them.
In the following dialogue, which is about different inventors, there 
are relative clauses. Single out the relative clauses in the dialogue 
with your partner and write your answers. The first one is done for 
you.
Eyosias:  What are you reading, Nataniym? 
Nataniym: I am reading a book about Thomas Edison who I admire . 
He invented the light bulb which greatly influenced the 
world. This can be our group report about the people who 
we admire.
Eyosias:  Too bad! He’s not the singer that I admire.
Nataniym: Thomas Edison is the greatest and first person that I 
admire. How about you, Rahel?
Eyosias:  I admire Thomas Edison, too. He never gave up or stopped 
his tests. After his team failed about 10,000 times, he 
cheered up the team.  What’s your idea about Thomas 
Edison, Yonas?
Yonas:` In fact, I admire Steve Jobs who made iPhone and iPad 
so popular. I like to do the report about him. Who do you 
admire, Eyosias?
Eyosias:  I admire Edwin Howard Armstrong whose radios helped 
the world a lot.

Have you noticed the linking words of the two clauses in the above 
activities? The linking words include who, whom, whose, that, 
which, what, when, where, and why. These linking words that form 
the relative clauses are called relative pronouns. 
Relative clauses are classified into defining and non-defining relative 
clauses. The defining relative clauses are clauses that provide 
essential information about the thing or the person that it describes. 
For instance, you may have many sisters and if you produce the 
statement My sister who works in Hawassa University was awarded 
a prize, your listeners may not understand you which of your sisters 
you are referring to. The relative clause which you have added as 
who works in Hawassa University clearly distinguishes which of 
your sisters you have referred to. This kind of relative clause that 
determines the noun is called defining relative clause. You should 
not use commas with defining relative clauses. Please read example 
sentences 1-5 below. The non-defining relative clauses, on the 
other hand, are clauses that provide information about the things or 
the persons described in the sentence, but the information does not 
determine the things or the persons they describe. For example, in 
sentences like My father, who is over 60, still works on the farm, it 
is clear that you have only one father; therefore, the relative clause 
who is over 60 is not essential to tell us about your father although 
it adds some information  about your father’s age. Non-defining 
clauses are set-off by commas to indicate that the clause is not 
determinant of the noun used. Read the examples 6-10 below for 
more understanding.Grade 9 English Textbook 153 § Grammar

Sample essay
Read the following essay, and develop similar kind of essay of your 
own about the basic needs of the people and land degradation.
Developing countries and problems they face
There are basic needs which developing countries lack in part or in total. 
The basic needs include food, water, housing, health, education and work. 
Food is a basic need because food helps people grow and develop. It gives 
us energy to keep us health and work. Without the right amount of food or 
the right kinds of food, people suffer from malnutrition which can result in 
death. At least one in eight of the world’s population does not have enough 
to eat. Water, clean, safe drinking water is essential for life. It is vital for 
the control of diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid and cholera. About 80% 
diseases are from dirty, unsafe drinking water. 
 Housing is a major problem, which can affect the developing countries 
because more and more people in developing countries are drawn to cities 
in search of work and a better life. The cities getting overcrowded and the 
supply of affordable housing in the cities does not match the population 
growth so there is a serious of lack of houses, so in developing countries 
there are nearly more than half of the population living in shanty towns. 
Health care is important to ‘ensure a state of complete physical, mental 
and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or illness. 
70% of the population in developing countries does not have access to any 
organized health care.  
Education is another problem in poor countries. There are only four adults in 
ten who can read and write and less than one in four children go to secondary 
school. Education is a very important basic to the development of a nation. 
To solve the problems of basic needs, people in developing countries 
should work hard cooperatively to ensure their basic needs are satisfied.  Grade 9 English Textbook160

HIV/AIDS
1. Within the next 25 years, AIDS is set to join heart diseases and 
stroke as the top three causes of death worldwide. Currently 
ranked fourth behind heart diseases, stroke and respiratory 
infections, AIDS is set to become No.3. It accounts for about 
2.8 million deaths every year. But researchers estimate  a 
total of nearly 120 million people who could die in the next 
25 years. Overall, researchers predict that in the next three 
decades, the causes of global mortality will be strikingly 
similar worldwide—apart from the prevalence of AIDS in 
poorer countries. Most people will be dying at an older age 
of non-infectious diseases like cardiovascular diseases, 
stroke and cancer.
2. The World Health Organization estimates that a total of 
at least 117 million people will die from AIDS from 2006 
to 2030. In an optimistic  future projection, if new HIV 
infections are curbed  and access to life-prolonging anti-
retroviral is increased, 89 million people will die from the 
disease.
3. “What happens in the future depends very much on what 
the international community does now,” said Mathers, who 
is a doctor. These marked differences should spark changes 
in current approaches to controlling AIDS now, say some 
experts.
4. ”It will be increasingly hard to sustain treatment programmes 
unless we can turn off the tap of new HIV infections,” 
said Richard Hays. “These AIDS numbers point to a need 
to do more in prevention.” Simply focusing on treatment 
or politically uncontroversial prevention methods will Grade 9 English Textbook164 § Reading Skills

not suffice.  “You can’t put all your eggs in the abstinence 
basket,” said Hays.
5. “We need a menu of strategies for real people,” he said, 
adding that condom distribution as well as new methods, 
such as a vaccine, are needed.
6. Mathers and Loncar analysed data from more than 100 
countries. The authors looked at the links between mortality 
trends and income per capita, as well as factors including 
education levels and tobacco use. Their research also used 
UN estimates for projected AIDS infection rates and the 
World Bank’s numbers for future income per capita. They 
predicted the future causes of deaths and diseases.
7. “This is an important contribution that will help us determine 
the priorities in public health,” said Majid Ezzati, a doctor 
and an associate professor of international health at Harvard 
University, who was not connected to the paper. While it may 
be possible to avert  some of the impending damage from 
HIV/AIDS, Mathers says that other predictions are unlikely 
to vary significantly. As populations age, he explains, they 
are naturally more susceptible  to illnesses like cancer and 
heart diseases than infectious diseases-even in the developing 
world. Life expectancy is expected to increase worldwide, 
with the highest projected life expectancy in 2030 to be in 
Japanese women at 88.5 years.

Present Perfect and Present Perfect 
Continuous Tenses
How are present perfect and present perfect continuous tenses 
formed? Read the excerpt in the Box, and identify the present 
perfect and present perfect continuous tenses. 
Our friend has disappeared . We have been looking  for him day and 
night, searching frantically in places where he is likely to be found. He 
is nowhere to be seen. Even his sister does not know where he is. He just 
ran off like that, vanished like thin air. We are not surprised as a matter of 
fact. He has been feeding  us with fat lies and the time of reckoning has 
come . We all believe so.
Since the day we made friendship with him, he has been taking  us for a 
swim, to a café, or other recreation areas and makes us pay the expense. 
He thought that we were foolish for being friends with him. He has been 
taking  our respect and loyalty for granted. He has never fulfilled  any of 
his friendship promises. Naturally, we got fed up with him. At first, we 
have protested  against him verbally, but he has refused  to hear us. So 
we have left  him alone. Now, he has disappeared  for good. I think he 
might have psychological problem we were not aware of.
 ʯActivity 8.9 Write down the verb tenses you 
have identified in the box above.  
 8.4.1 The Present Perfect Tense
How are the forms of the verbs different? The present perfect verbs 
has appeared, has come, has fulfilled, have protested, has refused, 
have left, and has disappeared are formed by having the ‘have 
verbs’ (has or have) and the past participles of verbs. ‘Have’ is used Grade 9 English Textbook 169 § Grammar  
u
n
i
t
8
as a helping (auxiliary) verb in ‘ have protested’ and ‘have left’, 
but ‘has’ is used with all other present perfect verb tenses in the 
excerpt. Note that ‘have’ is used when the subjects of the sentences 
or clauses are plural, while ‘has’ is used when the subjects are 
singular. See more examples below.
Examples
 1 The teacher has given  us a test on Chapter 5.
 2 I have lived  in Benshangul all my life.
 3 I have taken  care of communicable diseases.
 4 Communicable diseases have killed  many people in the world.
 5 Zelalem has finished  his studies.
Now look at the Box and note how the present perfect is formed.
Subjects Example sentences
Singular The teacher has finished her/ his / work/lessons/ studies.
Zelalem has finished his work/ his studies.
She has finished her work/ her studies
He has finished his work/ his studies.
Plural Communicable diseases have killed many people in the

 2 I have not (haven’t) lived  in Benshangul all my life.
 3 I have not (haven’t) taken  care of communicable diseases.
 4 Communicable diseases have not (haven’t) killed  many people in

 4 Have (Haven’t) communicable diseases killed  many people in the 
world?
 5 Has(Hasn’t) Zelalem finished  his studies?
When you form the present perfect tense, you have to carefully use 
the past participle forms of verbs. Some of the verbs add ‘-d’ or ‘- 
ed’ when they form their past participle; and such verbs are called 
regular verbs. However, verbs like, take, give, leave  form their 
past participle form, as you see in the examples and the excerpt, 
differently. They are called irregular verbs.  Now discuss in a 
group of four and write ten regular and irregular verbs, which you 
will share to the whole class. 
The most important point you should know is the meanings of 
sentences with present perfect tenses. Let’s learn the meaning of 
the sentences from the following examples. Grade 9 English Textbook 171 § Grammar  
u

t
8
Examples
 1 I have repaired  my bicycle.
 2 She has eaten  her breakfast.
 3 They have finished  their jobs.
In all the above sentences, the actions expressed by the verbs have 
repaired, has eaten and have finished show that the actions were 
completed in the past, but you inform people now. As you see the 
time when the actions were done is not expressed (told). Look at 
also the following examples in which you can understand a different 
meaning of sentences with the present perfect tense.
Examples
 1 I have lived  in Bahir Dar since 1959.
 2 She has learned  English for six years.
 3 The students have been  in the Club since they joined secondary 
school.
 4 Covid-19 has expanded  all over the world since a year ago.
Unlike the above examples which indicate actions that were 
completed, these examples show that the actions began in the past 
and continue until the present time. For instance, the meaning of the 
first example is that I began living in Bahir Dar starting from 1959 
until now.  The rest of the above examples have similar meanings.

Equality, Equity and Justice
1. Equality aims to ensure that everyone gets the same things in 
order to enjoy full, healthy lives. On the other hand, equity 
involves trying to understand and give people what they 
need to enjoy healthy lives. Sometimes, these terms are used 
in an interchangeable manner, which leads to confusion. For 
example, like equity, equality also aims to promote fairness 
and justice, but it can only work if everyone starts from 
the same place and needs the same things. There exists a 
thin layer of similarity in purpose but different approach 
has to be applied for fair results. One might think both are 
pretty much the same but in actuality, they are very different 
concepts that cannot be accurately explained by a simple 
definition. Justice is the collective responsibility of a free 
and just society, to ensure that civil and human rights are 
preserved and protected for each individual regardless of 
gender, race, ethnicity, nation of origin, sexual orientation, Grade 9 English Textbook184 §Reading Skills

class, physical or mental ability, and age. It can be considered 
as a scheme  of law in which every person receives his/her 
due from the system, including all rights, both natural and 
legal.
2. It is good to understand the difference between equity 
and equality as it helps us to recognize and respond to the 
differences. Let us analyze it on the basis of few examples: 
Should per student funding at every school be exactly the same? 
If we evaluate it, we find that it is the question under the 
domain  of Equality. Here, we make sure that all the students 
have equal access to resources which is an important goal. 
All the students should have the resources necessary for a 
high-quality education.
3. But if we go deeper, we see another question arising. That is, 
should the students who come from less get more in order to ensure 
that they can catch up? It is the question of equity where it is 
sensed that the students who are furthest behind (most often 
low-income students and students of color) require more of 
those resources to catch up, succeed, and eventually, close 
the achievement gap.
4. And on the resulting ground, we come to a conclusion 
to these questions that giving the students who come to 
school lagging academically (because of factors outside of 
a school’s control) the exact same resources as students in 
higher income schools alone will not close the achievement 
gap. But making sure that low-income students and students 
of color have access to exceptional teachers and that their 
schools have the funding to provide them with the kind of 
high-quality education they need to succeed will continue 
us on the path towards narrowing that gap.Grade 9 English Textbook 185 §Reading Skills

5. If we look at another example about the runners sprinting  
around an oval track during a competition, through this 
concept of equality we should treat the runners in exactly 
the same way, ensuring that they all start at the same place 
on the track. On the surface, this seems fair. But we know 
that runners in the inside lanes have a distinct advantage 
over runners in the outer lanes because the distance they 
have to travel is shorter. As a result, equality — starting at 
the same place — doesn’t result in fairness. The concept 
of equity, in contrast, would lead us to stagger  the starting 
positions of the runners in order to offset the disadvantages 
facing those in the outer lanes. In this case, different or 
tailored treatment is a surer path to fairness and justice than 
the same treatment . John Rawls says justice is of central 
importance in political practice and theory. In defending or 
opposing laws, public policies and administrative decisions 
of governments, appeals are made to notices of justice. 
Justice is also invoked  in social and political movements, 
civil- disobedience and opposition campaigns. Thus, the civil 
rights or civil liberties movements are essential movements 
for justice. While a decent or good society or polity  must 
have several virtues, according to a widespread view justice 
is the first of them. But the real question is how many are 
following the path of justice. We live in a materialistic 
world, where ethics, laws and order etc. are less cared 
about. Everything can be purchased with money even love 
and respect. People generally measure others on the scale 
of richness , “the richer a person is, the more will be his love and 
respect in the society’’ and vice-versa. Confucius once said , “In 
a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. 
In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed Grade 9 English Textbook186 §Reading Skills

of”. People with lack of money suffer everywhere; they not 
only struggle for their survival but also find it hard to earn 
respect in the society. Being poor is a curse , people with no 
money end up doing low paid jobs with no bright future. We 
can see examples of many domestic workers who work hard 
day and night in the same household throughout their life.
6. Justice, we see, manifests itself through the channels that 
society set up. Setting these channels involve laws that are 
set down by the founders and later rulers of the society. In 
theory, this is done by a person or group of people selected 
by the community and with inputs from the community 
regarding what issues are important. In practice, though, 
laws are often created by rulers without the input of the 
people or without certain situations in mind. This is when 
the principles of justice and fairness come in. Though there 
are a lot of ways but in many ways the best way to practice 
fairness and justice that has been found so far is the court 
system. For example: When a crime has been  allegedly  
committed under the law, the perpetrator  is allowed a trial by 
jury. The jury is constructed of people from the community 
who have no interest or previous disposition in the case. 
Thus, the jury is theoretically fair. The defendant and the 
accuser both have their chances to present their reasons for 
why a certain verdict should be given. It is not only the job 
of the jury to discern  what events took place and whether 
they are illegal, but also whether the law is justly applied 
to the current case. In theory, the jury (given true evidence) 
will decide what is best for the community in the particular 
case.Grade 9 English Textbook 187 §Reading Skills

7. To conclude, I quote Mahatma Gandhi: ” peace will not come 
out of a clash of arms but out of justice lived and done by unarmed 
nations in the face of odds”. We are the ones responsible 
for our world. Change from us can ultimately change our 
societies for better. We must advocate to the people about 
“equality, equity & justice, educate them about their rights 
and encourage them to treat others fairly, equally and nicely. 
That is how we will end up creating a beautiful society for 
our future generations .

2. Justice can be understood as a legal system, in which every 
person receives his/her due from the system, including all 
rights.
3. Usually laws are created by rulers without considering 
their people’s opinions or reflections.
4. For equity reasons, students who come from low social 
status must not get more resources than other students.
5. Equality can be granted through creating equal access to 
resources to every individual regardless of race and social 
class differences.

The roles of computers and Internet in our lives
Computer and the Internet
1. Computer is perhaps the most controversial inventions of 
the 20th century. Ever since Bill Gates made it a household 
name, people have been debating over its merits and 
demerits. Most students would agree that the computer is 
the greatest invention on earth because it has opened up a 
vast store of easily available information for them. At a click 
of the mouse they get to learn all the things that help them 
to keep abreast with today’s fast moving world. However, 
for each positive aspect of the computer there is an equal or 
more negative counter  point.
2. Worksheets are the days of vigorous  handwriting practice. 
The computer has come as a blessing for students who can 
now submit their assignments in neat and legible  sheets. 
They can loop up any information to put together their 
projects and use various software applications to present 
them in an impressive manner. Colored graphs and diagrams 
can be inserted, there is very little scope  of spelling errors 
and even grammatical mistakes are done away with.Grade 9 English Textbook 207 §Reading Skills
u
n
i
t

3. Knowledge increases with its spread and anyone who wants 
to spread his thoughts and knowledge can put it on the 
internet. It is available to the world and research students no 
longer need to labor through piles and piles of manuscripts. 
Universities can be contacted, websites can be consulted 
and even queries are answered through the internet . All 
these  save them a lot of time, labour, as well as money. For 
those who want to discuss, there are numerous e-forums and 
conferences that they can log onto. They can always indulge 
in a healthy interaction with other literary enthusiasts.
4. As computers become increasingly pervasive  into our lives, 
an increasing number of people are facing problems on 
the domestic front because of computers and the internet. 
Individuals are spending hours on end chatting or surfing 
on the net, but they do not have time for the other members 
in the family. Each one is becoming less communicative 
and more dependent on the computer. Children, especially 
of the advanced and more developed countries are known to 
spend 20 hours a week playing computer games.
5. Alternately, computers are helping to build up a global family 
instead of narrow groups based on community and caste . 
The different groups that can be found on social networks 
are witness to the growing popularity on ‘international 
communities’.
6. In a very short time people can be brought together, to 
protest against some wrong, to fight for some right or garner  
support for someone. As people become increasingly aware 
of what is going on in the world, more and more people 
are involving themselves in the service of other. There are 
doctors who can be consulted online, lawyers who clarify Grade 9 English Textbook208 §Reading Skills
u
n
i
t
10
legal points and teachers who help students with their 
assignments. There are net cafes that allow people to play 
online video games – most of which show a lot of violence 
and aggressiveness.
7. Children, who spend a substantial time playing these games, 
believe that such violence is the accepted behaviour in 
life too. If on the other hand playing of video games can 
be restricted and supervised, children can develop better 
reaction time, visual activity and dexterity . Is it not amazing 
to know that a child sitting in the US may be playing a game 
with a child in Japan, or Australia? This international level 
of activity, excludes a lot of negative prejudices allowing 
the child to develop into a world citizen. However, the child 
can very easily get in touch with negative groups also.
8. Sadly, the advent of computers and the internet has rung 
the death knell on a lot of habits that are essential for the 
development of a good character. Reading is one such 
habit that is fast dying. Be it the daily newspaper or a work 
of fiction, the practice of group reading is decreasing. 
Communicative skills are deteriorating  and health too is 
suffering because of the long hours spent sitting in front 
of the computer. It depends on our wisely making use of a 
computer to turn it into a boon  instead of a bane for us.

running before. In fact, I had never run more than a mile, and I had 
always been very slow. My friends thought I was joking. Everyone 
assumed that I would quit after a week.
Fortunately, I proved them all wrong. I did two things to achieve 
my goal. First, I went online and researched a good training plan. I 
found a website that helps me plan workouts. I start by walking, and 
then I gradually start running. After that, I joined a local running 
group. We ran in the park twice a week, and I made friends who had 
also decided to run a 5K.
Three months later, I achieved my goal: I ran in my first race. I 
didn’t win, but I ran the whole way, so I was proud of myself. Since 
then, I have run in several races. I have also started training for a 
longer run. My next goal is to run in a 10K race. My friends have 
stopped laughing at me, and a few of them have even asked me to 
help them start.Grade 9 English Textbook216 §Grammar

Sample Essay: Importance of the Internet  
The last few years have witnessed heavy reliance on the internet. 
This has been because of multiple advantages that it has to offer 
– for instance reducing the work stress and changing the face of 
communication most importantly. If we take the current scenario, 
we cannot ignore how important the Internet is in our everyday 
lives. It is now indeed a challenging task to visualize a world 
without the internet.
One may define the internet as a large library composed of stuff like 
– records, pictures, websites, and pieces of information. Another 
sector in which the internet has an undeniably important role to 
play is in the field of communication. Without access to the internet, 
the ability to share thoughts to share thoughts and ideas across the 
globe would have also been just a dream.

agreements or disagreement to

4. I believe that we should depend less on technology. We 
should be creative, ____________________.
5. In my experience, men tend to be more immature than

following topics following the 
example short paragraphs 
below.
1. I think we can combat climate change by growing trees. 
2. I think the computer was the best invention. There’s no 
question about it.
Example paragraphs of polite agreement and disagreement to the 
statement the different regions of Ethiopia have best staple foods.
Polite agreement
In my opinion, the different regions of Ethiopia have special staple 
foods that are delicious. For instance, the Tuhlo in Adigrat and the 
Kocho in Gurage are delicious foods. When one eats the kocho with 
chopped up meat called kitfo locally, he/she may think that there is 
no equal food stuff to it anywhere. Tuhlo has also very good taste 
and its food service tradition is special which is really very much 
attractive. Fish desserts in Arba Minch, the mitin shiro in different 
regions and the chicken stew are all delicious food stuffs everyone 
enjoys to eat. So, I feel that we have variety of delicious food stuffs 
which are much enjoyable in Ethiopia.  
Polite disagreement
The different cultural foods in Ethiopia may be enjoyable to many 
Ethiopians. But, I think the staple foods may not be delicious to 
tourists who haven’t experienced such kinds of food stuffs. Tourists 
who come from different corners of the world may have experienced 
different cultural foods of their own. To such kind of people, eating 
new food stuffs may not be easy. So, catering them with other 
choices seems mandatory . Grade 9 English Textbook222 §Writing Activity
