Activity 1  Introduction to History
History is the study of past events. The past can be millions of years 
ago. It can also be as recent as yesterday. In history, we study about past 
leaders, political structures, military organisations, our ceremonies and 
our means of livelihood in the past. There is political history, social history 
and economic history.
Group work
In groups:
a) What do you understand by the word Pre-Colonial era?
b) Differentiate between Pre-colonial era and history.
Sources of  information on history
These are things, places or people from where we get historical information. 
It is these sources of history that make us know what happened in the past.
The sources of information on history are divided into:
(i)  Primary sources       
(ii)  Secondary sources      
(iii) Tertiary sources
Primary sources
Primary sources of information give us first hand information about some 
historical happenings. They include:
(a)  Resource people
Resource people are people who witnessed some historical event. We have 
individuals who are experts in history and they teach others on what happened 
in the past. These include people who have gone through Western education 
and those who have not. Some elderly people like our grandfathers and Unit 
12grandmothers, aunts and uncles have lived long enough and seen a lot. Some 
have fought wars while others have entered into regional and international 
agreements as signatories or as witnesses.
(b)  Archaeology
This is the study of history through the excavation of sites and analysis of 
the materials found there. Archaeologists use fossils and artefacts to know 
the history of people in the past. Archaeologist Richard Lobban and his 
Italian and Russian friends unearthed the ancient and previously unknown 
Meroitic temple in 2011.This temple is believed to have been dedicated to 
the Egyptian sun god Amun.  
Fig. 1.1 Archeologists discovering the Meroitic temple
Many small pyramids have also been unearthed at Sedeinga by other 
archaeologists. Archaeologists work with paleontologists and geologists. 
Archaeology mainly gives us pre-historic  information.
(c)  Linguistics 
When one listens to people speak different languages he concludes a lot from 
the languages spoken. Some languages are similar while some have a few 
words that are similar. A lot is deduced from this. It can mean that the people 
are either related by blood or have interacted with the others in various ways 
like trade, migration or intermarriage. Language helps us trace migration 
patterns of communities and their relationships.
3Group work
1. In groups, pronounce these words in your mother tongue.
  a)   person    b)   child       c)   house           d)   seat
2. Identify the words that sound the same in different languages. Identify 
other similar sounding words.
3. Investigate how your community is related to other communities with 
linguistic similar words within your group.
(d)  Anthropology
This is the scientific study of a people’s way of life mainly through observation. 
Anthropologists live among communities they are studying for years to know 
their culture well. A people’s cultural practice reveals a lot about their history. 
They come to know about their ceremonies, their relationships and many 
other activities.
(e)  Genetics
Through the study of human, animal and plant genetics, we are able to find 
out which communities are related to one another by blood. We also come to 
know which areas domesticated what plants and animals and at what time.
(f)  Oral lore
Oral lore is also known as oral 
tradition . This is whereby 
cultural beliefs, traditions and 
practices of communities are 
passed and preserved orally 
from generation to generation. 
The people’s culture is found in 
their songs, folktales, chants and 
legends among others. Songs 
were sang at particular times 
in different communities. There is 
alot of history in traditional songs.
Fig. 1.2 An older person telling children stories4Secondary sources
Secondary sources of information are those sources that are created later 
by a person who did not experience the happening of an event. The person 
largely depends on the information provided by primary sources.
They include:
(a)  Written materials
They include manuscripts, stone tablets, clay tablets, books, magazines, 
newspapers and many others. In history, writing does not only mean writing 
on paper with a pen. Writings were done in ancient times on stones or mud 
using sharp objects. Some writings that were written on stones and bricks 
have lasted up to now and have been discovered and read.  In Sudan, 
writings dating back to about the 6th Century have been found in Kush. In its 
capital Napata, some buildings like temples were built from baked bricks and 
sandstones. Hieroglyphic writings were carved on the walls of the temples 
and painted with bright colours.
Fig. 1.3 A stone tablet, a book and a newspaper
Writings in ancient times were also done on skins and papyrus. With the 
discovery of the printing press, printed sources of history like books were 
made and produced in large numbers. 
These include spears, tools, clothes and pots. Each community had their 
own unique items that they used that we can use to identify them. However, 
those who stayed close to each other could copy skills of making items from 
one another. This copying has led to cases of different communities having 
similar items.
Tertiary sources
Tertiary sources of information are those sources that have been generated 
from primary sources and secondary sources. The information given by 
tertiary sources is mostly distilled.
They include:5(a)  Electronic sources
These include radios, televisions, documentary films and the internet. The 
internet is a one stop shop for historic information. Radios and televisions air 
news and other important historical documentaries.
Work to do
In groups discuss the following questions.
1. Find out at least 5 famous documents that relate to the history of 
Africa in the pre-colonial period. Write down what the documents 
tell us about this period.
2. Who was the first president of South Sudan? How did you know this?
3. Do you come from different communities? Are there similarities 
between the traditional pots, houses, baskets or spears of the 
different communities. Give reasons why this might be the case.  
4. In South Sudan we have Nilotes, Bantus and Cushites. Why are they 
categorised as so? Are there some Cushitic words that are found in 
Nilotic languages and vice versa? Why?
5. Give six reasons why you think it is important to study history. 
Present your answers in class.
6. In traditional Africa, there were songs sang during marriages, war, 
birth, naming, circumcision, tattooing, harvesting and so on. Do you 
know any of these songs? Sing the songs to the class.
7. These songs were sang hundreds of years ago. How did you come to 
know them?
Activity 2  Pre-colonial Trade in Africa
During the Pre-colonial period, there were different types of trade in Africa. 
There was Local trade  which involved a few people and occurred within 
a village or several neighbouring villages for example, among the Nuer or 
between the Dinka and the Nuer.6Class work
Visit the nearest market and observe what is happening.
The following questions will help you:
a)   What items are being sold?
b)   Are they using money to buy goods or exchanging goods for other 
goods?
Present what you observed in class.
There was Regional  trade  that involved different regions of Africa like 
the Long Distance trade and the Trans-Saharan Trade. There was also the 
International trade  that involved other countries outside the African 
continent like the Indian Ocean trade at the coast of East Africa and the 
Trans-Atlantic trade.  
Pair work
1. What is the meaning of the following? Use a dictionary if necessary.
  (a)   Berber
  (b)   Currency trade
2. Identify the type of trade in the following examples:
 (a) Alek exchanging a sack of sorghum for a cow from Deng.
 (b) Lichi buying a piece of land from Wawa using money.
Regional trade
The Trans-Saharan trade
This trade occurred across the Sahara desert. It involved two regions: North 
Africa and West Africa. Various reasons favoured its growth. These reasons 
include:
1. There was a high demand for trade goods both in the North and West 
of Africa. North Africans for example wanted gold from the West. The 
Byzantine Empire which controlled North Africa and the Middle East 
wanted gold to make coins and ornaments.72. There were strong rulers who supported the trade by ensuring that 
trade routes were secured. These rulers include the rulers of Mali and 
Songhai kingdom.
3. There were oases in the desert where traders and their animals could 
get water.
4. There were desert tribes like the Tuaregs and the Berbers who guided 
traders through the Sahara desert.
5. There existed local trade in both regions that supplied trade goods to 
the wider trade.
Organisation of  the Trans-Saharan Trade
Traders from the North moved with their goods to the West of Africa. Rich 
Arab merchants financed the trade. The trade goods from the North included 
salt, horses, clothes, glasswares and fruits like dates. Horses were at first used 
to carry the goods but as the Sahara became drier the camel replaced the 
horses. The camels used to be fattened for three months in readiness for the 
long journey to West Africa. The traders embarked on their journey after the 
rainy season was over to avoid desert storms. The traders moved in caravans 
for security reasons making this trade to be known as the Caravan trade . A 
caravan was made up of almost 1000 camels others were as large as 12,000 
camels.
Source 1
At that time we used to go ahead of the caravan and when we found a place 
suitable for pasturage we would graze our beasts. We went on doing this until 
one of our party was lost in the desert; after that I neither went ahead nor 
lagged behind. We passed a caravan on the way and they told us that some 
of their party had become separated from them. We found one of them dead 
under a shrub, of the sort that grows in the sand, with his clothes on and a 
whip in his hand. The water was only about a mile away from him. (Tales by 
Ibn Battuta)
Pair work
1. Why do you think the Trans-Saharan traders continued to engage 
in the trade even with its challenges? Be prepared to Present your 
thoughts to the class.8The Tuaregs guided the traders through the desert. They provided security 
from dangerous desert tribes. Runners were sent ahead of the caravan to 
fetch water because the water carried by the traders could not last them 
between oases. The Tuaregs took care of the oases.

Fig. 1.5 Trans-Saharan trade routes
On reaching West Africa, they exchanged their goods with West African goods 
like slaves, gold, ivory, kola nuts and gum. They used the system of barter 9trade in their exchange. There was no common language between the traders 
from the North and West. They exchanged the goods through gestures. This 
made the trade to be known as the silent trade . Berbers and Tuaregs acted 
as middlemen in this trade.
Trade routes
Source 2
a) “At Sijilmasa [at the edge of the desert] I bought camels and a four months’ 
supply of forage for them. Thereupon I set out on the 1st Muharram of the 
year 53 [AH 753, February 13, 1352] with a caravan including, amongst 
others, a number of the merchants of Sijilmasa. After twenty-five days 
[from Sijilmasa] we reached Taghaza, an unattractive village, with the 
curious feature that its houses and mosques are built of blocks of salt, 
roofed with camel skins. There are no trees there, nothing but sand. In 
the sand is a salt mine; they dig for the salt, and find it in thick slabs, lying 
one on top of the other, as though they had been tool-squared and laid 
under the surface of the earth. A camel will carry two of these slabs…
(Tales by Ibn Battuta)
Pair work
1. Using the source above, write an essay on how the desert conditions 
were.
2. Discuss the impacts of Long Distance trade with your partner. Who 
were the winners and losers?
3. Write down the positive and negative effects of the Long Distance 
trade.
Traders used particular trade routes from the North to West African. One 
such trade route ran from Fez in Morocco through Sijilmasa to the Niger belt. 
Another started at Tunis through Agades, Kano then to Hausa. There was 
another that started from Tripoli through Murzuk, Bilma then Karnem Bornu. 
Later, currency was introduced in the trade. Copper from Takedda was used 
as a form of currency.  
After exchanging their goods, the traders from the North embarked on their 
journey back. 
Slaves at this time were treated relatively well and used as domestic servants.10Group work
1. Carry out a research on the items of trade in the Trans-Saharan 
Trade.
2. In your exercise books, draw a table of items from North Africa and 
items from West africa.
Items from North Africa Items from West Africa 
Decline of  the trade
Source 3
 For Tuareg, the salt caravan is not something just for money, it is a tradition. 
‘If in your life you do not do it once or twice you are not considered Tuareg. 
So for me [the trucks mean] the end of Tuareg culture. I am not saying the 
camels will disappear, but I’m very worried that in three to five years all the 
salt caravans will be by truck.’ (Harding 2010)
The following factors led to the decline of the Tran-Saharan trade.
1. The Portuguese started trading along the West African coast from around 
1445. They were followed by other Europeans. The North Africans 
preferred to trade with the Europeans than the West Africans as the 
journey to the coast was not as risky as the long dangerous journey 
through the Sahara desert. 
2. The Europeans started going to the interior of West Africa from the 
Atlantic coast to get trade items. This reduced the role of the African 
middle men in the trade.
3. Morocco attacked major trading towns of Timbuktu and Gao from 1591-
1592. This was known as the battle of  Tondibi . She  destroyed its 
buildings and property and exiled some of its residents. This disruption 
led to the decline of the trade as animosity arose.
4. The Tuaregs who were guides started stealing from the traders.
5. Salt, which was a main trade commodity from the North got exhausted.116. The campaign against slave trade and eventual abolition of the trade 
reduced slaves as items of trade. 
The impacts of  the Trans-Saharan Trade
1. This trade resulted in the growth of urban centres which were built from 
the wealth got from the trade. These urban centres were located along 
the trade routes. Such towns included Timbuktu, Ghadames, Taghaza, 
Kumbi saleh and Marakesh.
2. Islam spread from the North to the West along the trade routes.
3. Attacks on other communities increased. They were done by those who 
got guns from the trade.
4. Kingdoms grew because of the wealth they got from the trade like the 
Mali, Ghana and Songhai Empire.
5. The middlemen and traders grew very rich from the trade.
6. The traders from the North introduced Islamic learning institutions in 
West Africa.
7. Local trade developed as it provided the goods for the Trans-Saharan 
trade. 
8. Arabic architecture was introduced in West Africa.
9. Transport improved in West Africa due to the introduction of camels 
and horses.
Pair work
1. The traders who took part in the Trans-Saharan Trade faced very many 
challenges. 
(a) Discuss with your friend the challenges you think the traders faced.
(b) Write down the challenges the traders faced and how they dealt 
with them in your notebooks.
Activity 3  The Long Distance Trade
The Long Distance Trade occurred between the East Coast of Africa and its 
interior in the 19th Century. It was conducted on a very large geographical 
area covering present day Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, 
Congo, South Sudan and Sudan. Goods from this trade were mostly sold at 
the coast of East Africa to Europeans and Asians. 12Factors that favoured the growth of  the Long Distance Trade
There were many factors that favoured the growth and development of Long 
Distance Trade. They include:
1. Availability of trade goods like copper, slaves, ivory and salt.
2. Demand for goods like ivory, gold and slaves. The Omani Arabs at the 
coast of Kenya needed very many slaves to work in their plantations 
at the coast of East Africa. The Sudanese Arabs also wanted slaves 
and ivory so did European countries and the United States of America. 
Slaves were needed to work on the sugar plantations of Mauritius and 
Reunion Islands.
3. There were leaders who organised the trade in their areas for example, 
Chief Kivoi of the Akamba in Kenya, Sultan Seyyid Said from Zanzibar 
and Tippu Tip from the Nyamwezi.
4. The Sultan of Zanzibar made deals with leaders in the interior of East 
Africa to ensure the safety of his traders.
5. The Sultan introduced a uniform custom tax throughout the area he 
controlled in East Africa and this encouraged trade.
Organisation of  the Long Distance Trade
Traders in Kenya like the Akamba organised themselves into caravans that 
went deep in the interior of Kenya to get ivory. The Akamba were good 
hunters and acted as middlemen in this trade. They carried with them 
European goods like clothes and brass wires which they exchanged with the 
traders in the interior.
In Tanganyika the communities involved in the Long Distance Trade included 
the Yao, Nyamwezi and Swahili. The Yao raided the interior for slaves and 
ivory and supplied them to the town of Kilwa at the Coast.  The Nyamwezi 
also raided the neighbouring communities for slaves. They transported them 
together with ivory, copper and salt to the Coast. The Nyamwezi went beyond 
Lake Tanganyika, and Malawi into what is now Eastern Congo to trade. Gold 
in this trade was from Zimbabwe and was sold to Sofala which traded with 
Kilwa.13
Fig.1.6: Map of the Long Distance Trade here showing the trade routes, the people 
involved and the trade goods
In the Northern part of Uganda, traders from Khartoum raided the area for 
slaves and ivory. By the 1870s, they had raided Uganda up to Lang’o area. 
The Mahdist revolution led to the decline of the Khartoum trade as it cut off 
Egypt from the North.
From the Somali ports of Mogadishu and Brava, traders followed routes into 
Northern Kenya or trekked into Ethiopia making use of trade routes that 
linked the Red sea and the Indian Ocean to get commodities.
In Central Africa, Msiri made contacts with Angolan traders and sent traders 
to Benguela and Bagamoyo to sell ivory and copper in exchange for guns and 
gunpowder. 
Later, Swahili and Arab traders from the East Coast dominated in this trade. 
They chose to go to the interior and get the goods themselves. In Kenya, this 
decision made the Akamba lose their position as middlemen in this trade. 
Caravans of about a thousand men each moved with their animals from 
the East Coast to the interior of East Africa. The Arab and Swahili traders 
from the coast were armed with guns they got from the coastal trade with 
Europeans. The Sultan of Zanzibar, Seyyid Said talked with leaders of the 14interior to allow coastal traders safe passage into the interior.  Some of his 
traders were not taxed as they passed through lands like in Nyamwezi. The 
Arabs and Swahili dominated the route which stretched from the coast to 
Tabora, Lake Tanganyika and to Buganda. Their main trading centres were 
Ujiji and Tabora. 
Traders used particular routes to trade. The captured slaves were used to 
carry the trade goods. They were beaten by the slave traders to walk faster. 
Those who were unable to walk fast, were shot dead or left to die in the 
forests.
The trading centre of Bagamoyo in the Republic of Tanzania got its name 
from the Swahili word Kubwaga moyo  meaning to give up or to lose hope. 
Captured slaves from mainland Tanzania always had the hope of escaping 
from their captors but when they reached at Bagamoyo the hope of ever 
escaping or seeing their families again dwindled. Bagamoyo was at the tip of 
mainland Tanzania. From there slaves were put on ships to Zanzibar where 
they were sold at the slave market. 
Slaves who were got from the interior were sold at the coast to Arab plantation 
owners in the towns of Zanzibar, Mombasa, Malindi, Kilwa and Pemba. They 
worked on farms and homes as domestic servants. Others were bought by 
Europeans and Americans to work on plantations, homes and mines. The 
slaves were kept in dug out holes in chains waiting to be sold. They were 
chained on metallic studs. Others were kept in natural caves like at Shimoni, 
Mombasa. They were sold through auctioning. Such holding holes were found 
in the coastal towns like Zanzibar and Mombasa. Zanzibar was the main 
slave market. From Zanzibar, slaves were taken to Arabia, Yemen, Turkey, 
India and Persia. They were used as sailors in Persia, pearl divers in the Gulf, 
soldiers in the Omani army and as workers on the salt pans of Mesopotamia.
The Long Distance Trade was also a caravan trade. There were caravans from 
the Indian Ocean Coast into the interior of East Africa. Others came from the 
interior to the coast. Barter trade was the method of trade but currency trade 
was also done. Human transport was mainly used in carrying goods together 
with animal transport. The traders used particular trade routes. The trade 
also involved middlemen. It involved countries covering East Africa, Central 
Africa and Southern Africa. The main commodities from East Africa interior 
were slaves and ivory.
Even as efforts to stop slave trade intensified in East Africa, the Long Distance 15Trade persisted for long because there was an internal market for slaves. In 
some regions of East Africa, there was slavery and slave trade up to the 20th 
Century. The Arab slave traders did not want to let go of their lucrative trade. 
They possessed modern firearms therefore it was hard to defeat them even 
with the involvement of European powers.

Read the following story then answer the questions that follow.
Salva, is a South Sudanese who lived during the Long Distance 
Trade. He benefited a lot from the trade. Together with the 
other traders, he had to raid the neighbouring communities for 
slaves which were important in this trade. However, one day 
his village was raided by rival traders who kidnapped his son. 
He suffered a lot of emotional turmoil.
1. Discuss the impact of the Long Distance Trade with your partner.
2. Who were the winners and losers in the Long Distance trade? 
3. Write down the positive and negative impacts of the Long Distance 
trade.
Effects of  the Long Distance Trade
1. There was a lot of fear in the inhabitants of East Africa due to slave 
raids.
2. Many people were displaced.
3. There were a lot of deaths.
4. Many families were separated as some were taken away as slaves.
5. Caravans of traders spread diseases like smallpox into the interior of 
East Africa.
6. There was animosity between communities due to slave raids. 
7. Some areas became depopulated. The Yao used to transport slaves to 
the coast but they did not raid for slaves. This was the situation until 
they were raided. They retaliated by getting stronger rifles and became 
ruthless raiders from around 1885. They attacked areas around Kilwa 
and Lake Malawi until they became depopulated.168. Many people in East Africa became rich from the trade as they were 
suppliers of commodities. Others grew food to feed the traders who 
passed in their land. Notable leaders who grew rich from the trade were 
Mirambo, Tippu Tip, Msiri and Nyungu ya Mawe.
9. There was increased insecurity in the whole of East Africa as 
communities raided each other. The Baganda for example, got guns 
from the Arab traders and raided their neighbours. 
10. Some kingdoms collapsed. The Shambaa kingdom in Tanzania collapsed 
in the 1870s as its rulers turned against their own people and sold them 
as slaves. 
11. Trading centres developed as some grew into towns. Examples of towns 
which grew as a result of this trade was Elureko (Mumias) in western 
Kenya. 
12. Islam was introduced into the interior of East Africa by the Arab traders. 
In Kenya for example, the area of Mumias has many Muslims than the 
surrounding areas. Mumias was a stopping place for Swahili and Arab 
traders on their way to Uganda.
13. New trade goods were introduced in the interior of East Africa. The 
new goods were clothes, guns, sugar and glass.
14. Currency was introduced in the interior of East Africa.
15. The trade led to the colonisation of East Africa as abolitionists appealed 
to their mother countries to come and stop slave trade.
16. Agricultural plantation flourished in the Coast and other parts of the 
world due to slave labour.
Factors that led to the decline of  the Long Distance Trade
1. The campaign in the world against slave trade. One of the main 
commodities in this trade was slaves. Anti-slave treaties were signed 
that outlawed slavery and slave trade in European nations and their 
colonies. This reduced the demand for slaves. Christian missionaries 
preached against slave trade and set up rehabilitation centres for freed 
slaves in East Africa. Slave ships were waylaid in the seas and captured 
and the slaves freed. 
2. Colonisation of East Africa. Any European nation that claimed any area 
had to stamp out slave trade and introduce legitimate trade.
3. Many European and American countries got industrialised and machines 
replaced the demand for human labour.17Group work

Activity 4  The Coastal Trade
This trade was between the East African coast, the interior of East Africa, 
Europe, Asia, America and the Middle East. Traders from the interior of East 
Africa brought trade goods to the coast and exchanged them with Europeans 
and Arab goods. These goods included copper, slaves, ivory, leopard skin 
were exported to Europe, India, America and the Middle East. This trade 
occurred at the same time as the Long Distance Trade. 
Factors that favoured the development of  this trade
1. The Long Distance Trade provided the much needed goods.
2. Seyyid Said introduced stronger currency in form of copper coins from 
India that facilitated trade.
3. He signed trade agreements with the Americans, French and British 
ensuring market for products from East Africa.
4. There was high demand for goods from East Africa especially slaves and 
ivory. Arabia was in high demand for slaves from non- Muslim areas as 
Islam does not allow enslaving of a fellow Muslim. Portuguese needed 
slaves for their plantations in Brazil. The ones from Angola were not 
enough. 
5. The coast of East Africa had deep harbours good for the foreigners to 
anchor their ships.
6. Existence of trading centres at the coastal towns made exchange of 
goods easier.18Organisation of  the Coastal Trade
Swahili, Arabs, Akamba, Yao and Nyamwezi traders organised caravans into 
the interior of East Africa where they got slaves, copper, ivory, salt, hoes and 
other items. They used slaves to carry the commodities to the East African 
coast. The Sultan of Zanzibar brought Indian Banyans who loaned money 
to traders. At the coast, the trade goods were exchanged with goods like 
clothes, beads and guns. The exchange was in barter and later currency was 
introduced. Slaves were decorated to increase their value on the day of sale. 
At Zanzibar for example, they were tied on a tree and whipped. The more 
one endured the whips, the higher price he or she fetched. The foreigners 
then transported the goods to their countries using ships mainly through the 
Indian Ocean.
Group work
1. From the organisation of the Long Distance trade, explain how the 
Coastal Trade was organised.
2. Draw a table to show what trade each community took to the Coast and 
what they got in return.
Factors leading to the decline of  the Coastal Ttrade
This trade actually still exists upto today except that the trade goods and its 
organisation have changed. East Africa still trades with the Middle East, India 
and Europe through the Indian Ocean only that this time it is legitimate trade.
However, there was a decline in this trade especially towards the end of the 
19th Century and beginning of the 20th Century. This was because of the 
abolition of the slave trade. Slaves were a major trade item in this trade.
When East Africa was colonised and new states established after the partition 
of Africa, trade between states was curtailed. Colonialists restricted the 
movement of Africans. They were no longer free to trade as before.

decline of the Coastal Trade.’19Impacts of  the Coastal Trade on the communities involved
1. It led to the establishment of good relations between East Africa, the 
Arab world, Europe and Asia.
2. Traders grew rich from this trade.
3. Slave trade led to deaths and fear among Africans.
4. The suffering of slaves attracted missionaries and humanitarians into 
East Africa to come and stop the slave trade.

Introduction
Colonialism  is defined as the occupation and control of one nation by 
another. Colonialism involves an external nation taking complete control 
of a territory in another area. Colonised people did not invite the colonial 
powers and they had no say in how they were governed. Colonialism is 
by definition and practice undemocratic. Colonisation of Africa occured 
between 1900s and 1970s. Colonisation of Africa involved the scramble 
and partition of Africa. 
The scramble  for Africa refers to the rush and struggle for different parts 
of Africa by the European powers. 
Partition  of Africa refers to the dividing of Africa among the European 
powers that were interested in colonies in Africa. Africa was partitioned 
and shared among European powers in a conference known as the Berlin 
Conference of 1884 to 1885. There were seven European countries 
which colonised Africa. These European countries were Britain, France, 
Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy.

Take up the White Man’s burden—
Send forth the best ye breed—
Go send your sons to exile
To serve your captives’ need
To wait in heavy harness
On fluttered folk and wild—
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half devil and half child
Take up the White Man’s burden
In patience to abide
To veil the threat of terror
And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple
An hundred times made plain
To seek another’s profit
And work another’s gain
Take up the White Man’s burden—
And reap his old reward:
The blame of those ye better25The hate of those ye guard—
The cry of hosts ye humour
(Ah slowly) to the light:
“Why brought ye us from bondage,
“Our loved Egyptian night?”
Take up the White Man’s burden-
Have done with childish days-
The lightly proffered laurel,
The easy, ungrudged praise.
Comes now, to search your manhood
Through all the thankless years,
Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom,
The judgment of your peers!

1. According to this poem, what is the white man’s burden?
2. With your friend, discuss the view point of the author.
3. What justifications are offered in the source to support the author’s view 
point?
Economic reasons
Economic reasons for colonisation of Africa were precipitated by the industrial 
revolution. Most European countries had industrialised by this period. They 
therefore needed goods and a market for their industrial goods.
The following were the economic reasons for the colonisation of Africa.
1. European countries were looking for cheap sources of raw materials 
for their industries. They were looking for resources such as palm oil, 
cotton and minerals.
2. They were also looking for a market for their finished products.  
3. They were looking for avenues to invest their surplus capital which 26they had accrued from trade and industrialisation. They believed that, 
investment in Africa was cheaper than in Europe because there was stiff 
competition in Europe. 
Social reasons
1. Europeans colonised Africa because they felt that they were a superior 
race who needed to civilise Africans. Civilisation involved eradicating  
bad practices such as slave trade and human sacrifices which were 
rampant in the African continent. To them, colonisation was seen as a 
blessing to Africa.
2. They wanted to convert Africans into Christians. This was done by the 
Christian missionaries. 
3. They colonised Africa to settle their surplus population, especially those 
who had been rendered unemployed by the industrial revolution and 
had resorted to social crimes such as prostitution, theft and riots.
Political reasons
1. Politically, nationalism and patriotism was an important factor for 
colonisation. Nations such as France wanted to restore their lost glory 
after being defeated by Germany in the Franco Prussian war of 1870.
2. Colonies were a symbol of supremacy. Powerful individuals such 
as writer W.T Stead encouraged the building of empires. European 
countries therefore colonised Africa because of public opinion. That 
was the idea of the moment championed by many people.
3. Some European countries such as Britain colonised some African 
countries for strategic reasons. They wanted to control the River Nile 
and the Suez Canal so that they could easily transport their goods. The 
Suez Canal shortened the distance between Africa and Europe by sea.

During the Berlin 
Conference of 1884-1885, 
Africa was shared among 
the seven European countries of Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, 
Portugal and Italy. The Berlin Conference was convened by the German 
Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck.  There were certain conditions set for any 
European power that wanted to colonise Africa. These conditions were 
known as the terms of the Berlin Conference. They stated:
a) That any state laying claim to any part of Africa must inform other 
interested parties. 
b) That all signatories must declare their “sphere of influence” which was 
an area under each nation’s occupation. 
c) That interested nations must effectively occupy their spheres of 
influence and establish administration. 
d) Countries must undertake to stamp out slave trade in the area they 
occupy.
28e) That River Congo and River Niger basins are to be left free for any 
interested party to navigate.
f) Countries with protectorates in Africa should have authority or establish 
administration to protect existing European rights and guarantee free 
trade.

Fig. 2.1 Map of Africa showing different areas which were colonised by different  
European countries
Sudan was administered by Britain and Egypt and was referred to as 
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Up to 1914, Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire 
(Turkey) and expanded its control to Sudan in the 19th Century. The Turko-
Egyptian masters were interested in slaves, ivory, gold and timber found 
in South Sudan. In 1881, the Mahdist revolt broke out and in 1882, Britain 
invaded Egypt. In 1899, they formally established a joint protectorate over 
Sudan; Egypt on the basis of its previous claims and Britain by right of 
conquest. Between 1914 and 1922, Egypt and Sudan was part of the British 
protectorate. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt and Sudan’s 
economic and strategic importance increased. In 1882, Britain occupied 29Egypt and Sudan.
After the Mahdist revolt which was a rebellion against the British led by a 
Sudanese religious leader Muhammad Bin Abdalla, the self-proclaimed 
“Mahdi” (Guided one), the British pursued a divide and rule policy. From 
1924, the British essentially divided Sudan into two separate territories, the 
predominantly Christian south where the use of English was encouraged by 
the missionaries and the Arabic North who were mainly Muslims.
Class work
1. (a) From the map that you drew during your pair work, are there some 
countries which were not colonised?
 (b) Write their names on a flash card or on the board.
Reasons why some countries in Africa were not colonised
There were only two African countries that were not overtaken and colonised 
by the Europeans. These are Liberia and Ethiopia.
The reasons why these countries were never colonised include:
1. Liberia has never been colonised because it was created artificially. It 
was a state formed in 1839 by Americans to resettle the liberated slaves. 
It therefore was under the United States of America where it was ruled 
by the white minority until 1847. Liberia’s connections to the United 
States made it unattractive as a target.
2. Ethiopia on the other hand successfully resisted Italian occupation 
under its leader Menelik II. He led the Ethiopians to a decisive defeat of 
the Italians in the battle of Adowa and secured Ethiopian sovereignty. 
Types of  colonial administration systems in Africa
After claims were made and borders drawn for African territories, European 
nations had to come up with a plan on how to govern their newly acquired 
colonies. There are several broad categories or divisions in which European 
nations ruled African colonies. The commonly used systems were direct rule, 
indirect rule and assimilation policy.
During the initial stages of colonisation, most European nations used 
economic companies to rule the region. The European governments provided 30these companies with charters who were 
responsible for all expenses of establishing and 
administering the colonies. This method was 
mainly used by the British and the Germans. 
The British East African Company established 
in 1888 colonised Kenya on behalf of the 
British and governed it until 1893. The British 
South African Company was formed in 1887 
under Cecil Rhodes and it colonised Malawi 
(Nyasaland), Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and 
Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). It governed 
these colonies until 1923. The German East African Company governed 
Tanganyika on behalf of the Germans. By around 1945, there were no 
company ruled colonies remaining in Africa.

present-day.)
Pair work
1. What message is the author conveying?
2. Do you think that African chief’s were cheated by the companies that 
they signed treaties with? Drawing your arguments from the source 
above, give reasons for your answer.
1. Company rule was used by European powers to minimise the costs of 
occupation and put in place effective administration of the colonies as 
per the clauses of the Berlin Conference.
2. European countries that used companies wanted the companies to 
exploit resources in their colonies so as to be able to meet the costs of 
administration. 
3. They wanted the colonies to be self-sustaining and not to become a 
burden to European tax payers.
4. The companies were expected to develop infrastructure in the areas 
and also end the African resistance.
5. Company rule was used because the companies’ officials were already 
working in Africa as traders.
Effects of  company rule
1. The companies were instrumental in ending local aggression in their 
areas of operation. The chartered companies laid basis for colonial 
administration by establishing administrative posts and centres.322. Chartered companies signed treaties with local leaders making it easier 
for the European powers to acquire raw materials or minerals from the 
colonies. For example, Lewanika of the Lozi signed the Lochner treaty 
with the British South African Company in 1890 giving the company 
mining rights in his kingdom.    
3. The companies developed infrastructure such as roads and bridges in 
their areas of operation.
4. The companies established industries for example; the British East 
African Company established a rubber industry along the coast of East 
Africa.
1.  Direct rule
Direct rule was a form of colonial administration. This was a system of 
administration where indigenous political and administrative institutions and 
leaders were replaced with a European system. The British, French, Belgians, 
Germans and Portuguese used this model. The European powers established 
centralised administrations usually in urban centres and they did not involve 
indigenous African rulers and governments. Direct rule used the strategy 
of “divide and rule” by implementing policies that intentionally weakened 
indigenous power networks and institutions.
This system worked well in places which already had large populations of 
Europeans for example, Zimbabwe. The Europeans also preferred using this 
system in places that were viable in terms of minerals and raw materials. 
African chiefs and headmen were stripped off their powers and their work 
reduced to recruiting their subjects to forced labour and maintaining law and 
order at local levels.   
Reasons why Europeans used the direct rule 
1. Direct rule was used so that the European powers would acquire full 
control of the economy and exploit resources such as minerals and 
farmlands.
2. This system was also used in places which lacked efficient traditional 
systems of political administration or those whose systems had been 
destroyed during wars of resistance.
3. This system was used where there were large populations of white 
settlement for example in Zimbabwe. It was hoped that the system 
would stop African resistance as Europeans were firmly in control. 33Effects of  direct rule
1. It solved the shortage of employment among the European population 
as they worked in the colonies. 
2. It undermined the pre-existing African traditional chiefs who were 
replaced by colonial appointees. In Tanganyika for example, Germans 
used Arabs, Akidas and Liwalis from the coastal areas as chiefs and 
headmen instead of the local people.
3. It managed to end African resistance especially in colonies that had 
enough white military forces.
4. It led to massive exploitation of Africans through oppressive colonial 
policies leading to land alienation, forced labour and taxation among.
2.  Indirect rule
This method of ruling was mainly used by the British. Indirect rule involved 
the use of indigenous African rulers within colonial administration although 
they maintained an inferior role. They worked under the supervision of 
European officials and received orders from them. Lord Fredrick Lugard, a 
British colonial administrator, used this system of government in Nigeria and 
in East Africa. This system was used in places where Africans had efficient or 
organised political institutions.
Structure of  the indirect rule
This system involved having Europeans occupy all senior positions. The 
African chiefs retained their positions but their work was outlined and 
curtailed. Their duties included settling disputes at local level, recruiting 
Africans to forced labour and eliminating practices that the British could not 
condone. In South Sudan, the British ruled through tribal leaders whom they 
gave “powers.” This use of “indirect rule” divided South Sudan into hundreds 
of informal chiefdoms. The British used “divide and rule” policy to separate 
Southern Sudanese provinces from the rest of the country slowing down 
their economic and social development. The British claimed that the South 
was not “ready to open up” to the modern world. They therefore, invested 
much in the Arab North. This created tensions and mistrust between North 
and South Sudan culminating into armed conflict in the 1950s. 
Reasons for indirect rule
1. The European powers that used this system lacked enough manpower 
to handle administrative responsibilities in the colonies. 342. This system was used to minimise the costs of administering the 
colonies as traditional political systems were used. 
3. Indirect rule was used to curb African resistance. This is because 
the traditional chiefs and leaders were used. However, most of them 
operated as mere puppet chiefs.
Group work
1. Conduct a research and find out the African countries which were 
colonised through the indirect rule .
 With your friend, discuss the specific reasons which led to the use of 
this rule in specific countries you have identified.  
 (a) From the reasons which favoured the use of direct rule, discuss with 
your friend what could have made the Europeans use the indirect 
rule.
 (b) Write the reasons in your notebooks.
Effects of  indirect rule 
1. It created tribalism. Chiefs who were given the power regarded 
themselves as superior to the others creating disunity. For example, in 
Uganda, Kabaka Edward Mutesa wanted independence for the Buganda 
kingdom only.
2. It led to unbalanced development in the colonies as areas where the 
chiefs came from developed in terms of social services like schools, 
hospitals and road networks. This has been a cause of conflict between 
people especially after independence.
3. Indirect rule turned chiefs to be puppets as they were used by the British 
and no longer worked for the interests of their fellow Africans.
4. It created social divisions whereby, some tribes became the ruling class 
while the others became suppliers of cheap labour.
5. It led to the extensive exploitation of Africans in terms of human labour, 
natural resources among others.353.  Assimilation policy
Assimilation means to make similar to. Assimilation policy was a system of 
administration mainly used by the French. It stated that French laws apply to 
all colonies outside France regardless of the distance from France, the size of 
the colony, the organisation of the society, the economic development, race 
or religious beliefs. It was the expansion of the French culture outside Europe. 
Assimilation was mainly practiced in Senegal and in the four provinces or 
communes of Dakar, Goree, Saint Louis and Rufisque. The Africans in these 
four communes of Senegal were easily assimilated because most of them 
were literate, knew the French language, were Christians and had long 
interactions with European traders. The colonies where this policy was used 
were regarded as other sea provinces of the French.
Assimilated Africans enjoyed privileges and rights that were given to any 
French citizen in France. They could be elected as representatives in the 
French lower House of Parliament. There was close economic relationship 
between France and the colonies as both used the French currency. 
Before Africans could be assimilated they had to:
1. Learn the French language.
2. Follow French laws. 
3. Apply French civil and political systems.
4. Convert to Christianity.
5. Practice monogamy.
Reasons for assimilation
Assimilation was used in French colonies due to a number of reasons. These 
reasons included:
1. The existence of a large percentage of children of mixed parentage; the 
“Mulatto” population who were easy to assimilate. This came about due 
to long interactions and intermarriages between the local people and 
European traders in these regions.
2. The Africans in the four communes of Senegal where assimilation 
was used were familiar with European colonial administrators and 
missionaries. 
3. Most of the Africans in this region had already been converted into 
Christianity which was one of the requirements for assimilation.36The features of  French administration

Effects of  assimilation 
1. This policy greatly undermined African culture as 
people were forced to embrace the French culture.
2. It eroded the authority of the traditional African 
leaders who were replaced by assimilated people. 
3. Africans were allowed to enjoy the rights of the 
French citizens such as participating in political 
matters. A Senegalese, Blaise Diagne was elected 
to the French lower house in 1914.
4. The system created a great rift between the 
assimilated Africans who were considered French citizens and the rest. 
This is because those assimilated were exempted from taxation and 
forced labour.
Association policy
This policy prevailed in the French colonies after assimilation failed. 
Association was a policy that respected African culture. It allowed Africans 
to develop independently and not force them to adopt the French culture. Its 
Fig. 2.3 Blaise Diagne37purpose was to create mutual economic development for both Africans and 
the French. Africans had the right of maintaining their own culture.
Group work
1. Carry out a research on factors that led to the decline of the 
assimilation policy.
2. Write the factors in your notebooks.
Effects of  association
(a) It did not interfere with African cultural practices such as religion, 
custom and traditions.
(b) Association policy did not consider the assimilated Africans as French 
citizens.
(c) French civil and criminal laws were not used on Africans in the colonies.
 The policy of assimilation and association in French colonies, still 
subjected Africans into oppressive laws and economic exploitation 
such as land alienation, taxation and forced labour.

Positive effects
1. New breeds of animals and crops that could do well under the African 
climate were introduced. Cash crops such as coffee, cocoa, tea and sisal 
were introduced.
2. Colonisation introduced a common currency which had not existed in 
the past.
3. Colonialism introduced new legal systems in Africa.
4. It brought manufactured goods into the continent.

5. It introduced new machines which are now used in agriculture and 
industry.
6. Colonial rule brought an end to slave trade which undermined the rights 
of people and eroded their dignity.397. Modern health facilities, formal 
education and other social services 
were introduced in Africa.
8. Colonial governments introduced 
modern methods of communication.
9. Many Africans learnt the language 
of their colonial masters like English, 
French, German so on, which has 
given them advantage to be able to 
communicate in the present globalised 
world without any difficulties.
Negative effects
1. The Africans lost their political independence.
2. Some traditional political institutions were destroyed and replaced with 
foreign ones.
3. Foreign culture was imposed on Africans without regard for their own 
culture. This led to loss of African culture.
4. Africans were converted into Christianity. They were made to believe 
that the traditional beliefs were primitive.
5. Africans lost large tracts of their land to European settlers.
6. Many Africans were forced to live in crowded areas and were never able 
to regain their land.
7. Africans were discriminated against and mistreated in their own 
countries.
8. The African continent was broken up into political units that later 
became independent countries.
9. The Africans were forced to trade with the colonial master much more 
than with fellow Africans living in neighbouring states.
10. Development within the colonies was not balanced or uniform. It tended 
to favour colonies occupied by white settlers.
11. Africans were viewed as slaves rather than free people. They were 
forced to provide free labour on European settler farms and mines.

“All the Powers exercising sovereign rights or influence in the aforesaid 
territories bind themselves to watch over the preservation of the native 
tribes, and to care for the improvement of the conditions of their moral 
and material well-being....” — ( General Act of the Berlin Conference, Article 
6, February 26, 1885 ely in central and southern Africa, late 1850s Comparison 
between colonisation in Africa and America .)
Group work
To what extent was the act fulfilled at the end of the colonial rule in Africa? 
Explain your answer.
Similarities
1. In both Africa and America, colonisers wanted to exploit natural 
resources. The resources varied from country to country ranging from 
minerals to agricultural products suitable for export to Europe. Profits 
from the exports were sent to Europe instead of promoting social and 
economic development in the colonies.412. Colonialism in Africa and America saw the introduction of taxes to the 
indigenous people for the maintenance of colony. 
Differences
1. Colonisation of Africa not only involved acquisition of resources but 
also the use of the people to provide free labour. Africans laboured in 
poor working conditions for long hours with inadequate pay. In the end, 
the Europeans left the African continent underdeveloped. Colonisation 
in America on the other hand involved Europeans relocating there with 
their families, developing the area and influencing America with their 
language and culture.
2. In Latin America, colonialism did not have much of an impact as the 
original natives (the Mayas, Incans, and Aztecs) mostly died of war and 
diseases or retreated into remote areas. It is the European population 
or mixed European-Indian ancestry that remained. This hastened 
development of the area, unlike in Africa which was left undeveloped 
yet exploited. The effects of this are still felt many years later as Africa 
lags behind in global development.
3. Colonisation period in America (Latin America) and Asia ended earlier 
than that of Africa. 
4. In America and Asia, colonial powers created territories based 
on economic considerations. There were large nations of diverse 
populations such as India, Indonesia and Malaysia making it possible 
for groups like Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs to co-exist in spite of bitter 
experiences. In Africa however, colonial powers drew boundaries based 
on tribal divisions and pulled off one tribe against another. In Rwanda 
for example, the Belgian colonial powers favoured the Tutsi over the 
Hutu. In Sudan, the British turned the Northern region against the 
Southern region. 
5. The perception of the native people by the European colonisers also 
varied. While Asia was seen as a backward nation, the Asians were 
generally seen as intelligent and cultured people who could be civilised. 
Africans on the other hand were viewed as barbaric, uncivilised people 
who needed to be dealt with ruthlessly. The British for example, 
introduced railways, parliamentary system of governance in India but 
they did not do much of the same in Africa.  When the Europeans left, 
unlike other places such as Latin America and Asia, Africans did not 
have institutions to build on.42Activity 3  African response to colonial rule
African communities responded in different ways to European occupation. 
The main responses were resistance  and collaboration .
Source 8
‘I have listened to your words but can find no reason why I should obey 
you—I would rather die first…. If it should be friendship that you desire, then 
I am ready for it…but to be your subject that I cannot be…. I do not fall at 
your feet, for you are God’s creature just as I am…. I am Sultan here in my 
land. You are Sultan there in yours. Yet listen, I do not say to you that you 
should obey me; for I know that you are a free man.” — ( King Machemba of 
the Yao in East Africa to German commander Hermann von Wissmann, 1980.)
Pair work
What does this source suggest about the altitude of African nations to colonial 
rule?
Resistance  refers to the struggle conducted by the Africans against 
imposition of colonial rule during their attempt to occupy the African land 
from 1880 to 1914.
Collaboration  refers to cooperation of some African communities to 
European colonisers mainly through signing of treaties.
There are those African societies or leaders who decided to fight Europeans 
right from the start. They are known as Primary resistors  for example, 
Samore Toure of the Mandika, Menelik II of Ethiopia, Nandi of Kenya and 
Kabarega of Bunyoro. There are other groups and leaders who welcomed 
Europeans and only decided to fight after realising that Europeans had taken 
their land and independence. These are called Secondary resistors . For 
example, Kabaka Mwanga of Buganda and Lebengula of the Ndebele. Some 
communities collaborated and cooperated with the Europeans for example, 
the Buganda, Ankole and the Maasai.43Reasons for African collaboration
1. Africans collaborated because they thought that this would protect their 
independence. Africans valued self-rule. They trusted the Europeans 
and did not expect the Europeans to betray them. Most of the African 
leaders were illiterate and the treaties that they signed were interpreted 
for them by the missionaries. They thought that the colonialists wanted 
to promote trade between their countries and Europe. 
2. Other African leaders collaborated because they wanted to get weapons 
and other forms of military support against their enemies. In Senegal 
for example, African societies collaborated with the French because of 
the threat from Samouri Toure of the Mandika Empire who wanted to 
conquer their areas to expand his kingdom. 
3. Some African leaders collaborated because of military weakness. 
Europeans had superior weapons and well trained armies. They saw it 
as futile fighting the Europeans and so they just gave in. In Kenya, among 
the Maasai for example, a Scottish trader called Andrew Dick opened 
fire killing 100 Maasai in what was called the ‘Kendong” massacre.’ This 
incident scared the Maasai who realised that resisting the British would 
be devastating. They saw that it was safer to welcome the intruders.
4. Natural calamities forced some Africans to collaborate. These communities 
had been weakened by both human and animal diseases and epidemics 
leaving them too weak to resist the intruders. The Banyankore (Uganda) 
for example were affected by jiggers and rinderpest. The Maasai of 
Kenya were weakened by small pox, rinderpest and internal conflicts. 
These African communities chose to collaborate to solve their problems.
5. African leaders collaborated to acquire wealth. They wanted clothes, 
beads, guns, mirrors and wine. They wanted to get European goods 
which they considered superior.
6. Some African leaders collaborated due to missionary influence. 
Missionaries invited their countries to take over areas where they worked. 
They convinced Africans to accept colonial rule through Biblical 
Scriptures such as all authority comes from God. They convinced them 
to sign treaties. For example, Francois Coillard, a missionary wrote 
a letter on behalf of King Lewanika of the Lozi in Zambia for British 
protection.44Reasons for African resistance 
Pair work
It is believed that many colonies brought development in Africa.
Why do you think some resisted?
Reasons for African resistance varied from community to community due to 
the fact that African experiences under the colonialists were not the same. 
These reasons were:
1. African communities resisted because they did not want to lose their 
independence as some colonialists interfered with their traditional 
political set ups.
2. Africans were against the loss of their land which was alienated to make 
way for European settlement.
3. Forced labour was a major grievance for the Africans. They detested 
being forced to work on European farms and government projects. 
Africans resisted due to the imposition of high taxes on them. Besides, 
the taxes were collected in a ruthless and demeaning way.
4. Africans resisted because of the harsh and ruthless way they were 
treated by the colonialists. They were viewed as slaves, tortured and 
even flogged in public for offences like drinking local liquor which was 
a common African traditional practice. 
5. Some African communities resisted because they were militarily 
superior at the time of colonisation. For example, the French came at a 
time when Samouri Toure’s empire was its the peak, enjoying military 
supremacy and economic prosperity.
6. African leaders inspired their people to resist for example; Kinjikitile 
Ngwale of Tanganyika promised his people immunity against European 
bullets by using the magic water which was a mixture of water, millet 
and maize flour.45Source 9
“The European merchant is my shepherd, And I am in want, He maketh me 
lie down in cocoa farms; He leadeth me beside the waters of great need; 
He restoreth my doubt in the pool parts. Yea, though I walk in the valleys of 
starvation, I do not fear evil: For thou art against me. The general managers 
and profiteers frighten me. Thou preparest a reduction in my salary In the 
presence of my creditors. Thou anointest my income with taxes; My expense 
runs over my income. Surely unemploymentand poverty will follow me All 
the days of my poor existence, And I will dwell in a rented house for ever!” 
— (“A Psalm 23, by an African Laborer,” The African Morning Post, Accra, 
Ghana, September 2, 1944.)
Pair work
What do you think the author is mainly complaining about from the secure 
above?
Reasons why African resistance failed
1. Africans had inferior weapons such as spears, bows and arrows while 
Europeans had superior and sophisticated weapons like guns.
2. Poor communication systems in Africa made them unable to coordinate 
their resistance activities. Europeans had disciplined and well trained 
armies in terms of tactics, strategies, weapons and information systems.
3. Africans had poor armies, tactics and strategies.
4. Inability to control natural calamities such as drought, famine among 
others weakened the African fighters making them unable to wage stiff 
resistance against the Europeans. 
5. There was disunity among African communities. Communities did 
not come together to fight against a common enemy. In fact some 
communities aided the Europeans against their fellow Africans by 
fighting for them as mercenaries (paid soldiers). For example, during the 
Maji Maji uprising of 1905 to 1907 against the Germans in Tanganyika, 
the Maasai, Baganda and Somali communities fought for the Germans 
against their fellow Africans. 
6. Unpopularity of some African leaders contributed to failure of 
African resistance. Some African leaders such as Shaka of the Zulu 46had autocratic behaviour and brutal systems towards their followers. 
Africans therefore hated their leaders and did not participate in the wars 
against imposition of colonial rule.
7. Africans had weak economic base making them unable to sustain 
resistance for long due to lack of food. This was also coupled by the use 
of the scorch earth policy by the colonialists which also destroyed crops 
and livestock leading to starvation. 
8. Some African communities relied so much on their beliefs, some which 
were false. For example, during the Maji Maji uprising in Tanganyika, 
Africans believed that the magic water made by their leader Kinjekitile 
Ngwale would make them immune to European bullets. This made 
them bold and courageous to attack the Europeans without arms and 
as a result, a large number were killed. 
African resistance though played a vital role in general and aimed at 
retaining independence from external domination. Even though most African 
resistance failed, Africans continued with their anti-colonial efforts by using 
other methods. These efforts liberated African countries from colonial rule.

SOUTH SUDAN
Introduction
In the 19th Century, Africa witnessed a lot of changes in her social, political 
and economic organisation. Before 19th Century, African societies evolved 
without any foreign influence. Most African societies later organised into 
small political units with no chiefs or kings.
In the early years of the 19th Century, there was the development of many 
states in the continent. States rose and conquered those which were weak. 
With a vast land to control, there was the need for a centralised form of 
governance.
Activity 1  Centralised and decentralised societies 
in South Sudan
South Sudan had various societies during the pre-colonial period. Some of the 
societies in South Sudan were centralised while others were decentralised.
Characteristics of  centralised societies
Source 1
Pair work
The source above shows images of drawings and a building that date from 
times when there were centralised societies in what is now South Sudan. What 
do the images suggest about the characteristics of centralised societies?Unit 
349a) Centralised societies had one overall political leader who had a lot of 
power. The overall political leader was either a king or a queen or an 
emperor.
b) Centralised societies had a standing army which defended the 
community during war.
Characteristics of  decentralised societies
a) In decentralised communities, political power was not in the hands of 
one person but in a group of people like the council of elders. 
b) Decentralised communities had warriors who defended the community.
There are many examples to give in South Sudan of centralised and 
decentralised communities. The Shilluk, Azande and Anyuak (Anywaa) 
were centralised communities while the Dinka and Nuer were decentralised 
societies.
Activity 2  The Shilluk Kingdom (1490-1865)
The Shilluk Kingdom is also known as the Chollo Kingdom. The Shilluk are 
part of the Luo Nilotes group. The Shilluk were a centralised community. 
They are also known as the Chollo. Their kingdom was situated on the banks 
of the White Nile. Its capital was at Fashoda. It was founded in mid-15th 
Century by a man known as Nyikang. He is said to have quarreled with some 
of his relatives and parted with them. He migrated to a different location with 
his followers who were then known as the Shilluk. He was regarded as a
semi-god. The Shilluk kingdom was therefore a sacred monarchy.
Political organisation of  the Shilluk
Source 2
The Shilluk king, or reth, was indeed said to embody a divine being—a god 
or at least a demi-god—in the person of Nyikang, the legendary founder of 
the Shilluk nation. Every king was Nyikang. The reth was not supposed to die 
a natural death. He might fall in battle with the nation’s enemies. He might 
be killed in single combat after a rival prince demanded a duel, as they had a 
right to do, or be suffocated by his own wives or retainers if he was seen to be 
physically failing (a state which was indeed seen to lead to poor harvests or 
natural catastrophes). On his death, though, Seligman emphasised, Nyikang’s 
spirit left him and entered a wooden effigy. Once a new reth was elected, 50the candidate had to raise an army and fight a mock battle against the 
effigy’s army in which he was first defeated and captured, then, having been 
possessed by the spirit of Nyikang, which passed from effigy back into his 
body, emerged victorious again.
Pair work
1. Discuss the sequence of events that are or might be involved in the 
transition from one King or Reth to his successor.
2. Present these events in form of a flow diagram.
The Shilluk Kingdom was a sacred monarchy ruled over by a king whose 
title was Reth . The Reth was a symbol of political unity. The kingdom was 
divided into two provinces; Gar (North) and Lak (South). The people lived 
in groups of villages known as Podho . There were fifteen provinces  each 
under a Paramount Chief. The Chief was responsible to the Reth. Each 
village had its own military and a military leader. The position of the king 
was hereditary. The king appointed chiefs to help him rule the kingdom. Each 
king after Nyikango is believed to have possessed his spirit. The selection and 
installation of a Reth was an elaborate ceremony full of rituals.  
Economic organisation
a) The Shilluk had good land for planting crops. 
They therefore practised crop cultivation and 
kept few cattle. They planted millet, beans, 
maize, sesame, pumpkin and sorghum. Men 
and women took part in agriculture. They also 
produced gum.
b) They were semi-nomadic cattle keepers as 
crop farming made them live a more sedentary 
life to take care of the crops. Men looked after 
livestock and milked cattle.
c) They raided their neighbours for cattle too.
d) They practised fishing in River Nile. 
e) They hunted animals and gathered wild leaves to supplement their 
meals. Men hunted while women and children gathered wild fruits and 
leaves.
Fig. 3.1 Shilluk king51f) They were also traders. They carried out small scale trade with Arabs 
and neighbouring communities.
g) The Shilluk were also craftsmen. They made jewellery, spears and 
daggers. 
Social organisation
The family (gol) or Kalo was the smallest social unit. The father was the head 
of the family.
The society was divided into social classes. The first social class was the 
Royal house (Kwa Reth).  Reth means King so these were the descendants 
of Nyikang. It was from this social class that a king was chosen. After the 
Kwa Reth were the ororo. They were the commoners. These were former 
members of the royal family who were disinherited of their royalty. Next 
were the Chollo who were descendants of non Shilluk people who settled in 
Shilluk territory. 
The last class was the Bang Reth. This was a class owned by the king. They 
included his royal wives and widows of dead kings. Others in this group were 
descendants of slaves captured in raids.
The Shilluk were polygamous. Bride price was normally in form of livestock. 
Marriage to a relative was prohibited. Divorce was rare but if it happened, the 
bride price had to be returned.
Boys were initiated into adulthood through a dance ceremony. After initiation, 
the boy was allowed to have his own sorghum field and marry. The Reth 
interceded for the whole community.
Decline of  the Shilluk Kingdom
Attacks from the Ottoman Empire and colonisation of Sudan by the British 
led to the decline of the kingdom. 
Today, the Shilluk still have their King but he is not an independent political 
leader. He operates under the South Sudan constitution. 
Class work
1. Research on the Shilluk community using a range of sources including, 
someone from the community if possible.
2. Find out as much as you can about the community including how 
elections for a new Reth took place.52Activity 3  The Azande Kingdom
The Azande are a Bantu community. The 
Azande means the people who posses 
much land. The Azande people are found 
in present day Democratic Republic of 
Congo, South Sudan and in the Central 
Africa Republic. The Azande Kingdom was 
created through military conquests and was 
ruled by two different dynasties; the Banda 
dynasty and the Vungara dynasty. In South 
Sudan, they live in the Central and Western 
equatorial states of Yei, Maridi, Yambio and 
Tambura or Tumbura. The word Azande 
means people who possess much land. 
They were fierce warriors who were able to 
acquire a lot of land through conquests. 
Political organisation
They were ruled by Kings. The kingdom was made up of many tribal 
kingdoms ruled by the Vungara dynasty.  After a King’s death, the sons would 
fight for the seat. The losing sons would move and establish kingdoms in 
neighbouring areas. This made the Azande Kingdom spread far and wide 
especially Eastwards and Northwards. 
Each kingdom was divided into provinces.
The king appointed chiefs to help him rule. 
The kingdom had a strong army which was feared by many. 
Economic organisation
1. In the Azande Kingdom, roles were gender based. The Zande were iron 
workers. They made iron knives, bows, arrows and swords. 
3. They were also mixed farmers. They kept animals like cattle and grew 
crops like millet and sorghum. They practised shifting cultivation. 
4. They hunted animals to supplement their meal. 
5. They traded with their neighbours. 
6. They made pots and baskets to store food and water.
7. They made baskets from barks and palm leaves. 
Fig. 3.2 Azande warriors53Social organisation
They lived in villages made up of related clans. Their houses were made of 
mud. It is the men who built huts.
They believed in a supreme god called Mboli  to whom they prayed and 
offered sacrifice. 
The society was divided into two. The Avungara  who were related to their 
great leader Gbudwe and his two sons Yambio and Tambura. The second 
group was the Amborrou  whose cradle land was the valleys of River Mbomu. 
Then there were the commoners who were not Zande but were captured in 
wars of conquest and assimilated. The commoners were also called Auro. 
They had a strong belief in witchcraft. They believe that witchcraft was an 
inherited substance located in the belly of a person. Many wore charms 
to protect them from bad spirits. Chiefs used witchcraft on persons who 
had committed crime especially big crimes like adultery and murder. The 
witchcraft was able to determine who had committed a crime. Thieves were 
punished by having their ears cut.

1. The source summarises some of the Azande beliefs about witchcraft 
as explained by the anthroplogist, Evans-Prit Chard, in 1937. What are 
their central beliefs about witches? What do they believe can happen as 
a result of Mangu? 
2. Do you believe in witchcraft? Do your people practise witchcraft? 
Discuss with your friend how they carry out the practise.
The Zande were polygamous. Bride price was in form of iron spears. Men 
who could not afford the bride price could at times arrange to marry each 
other’s sisters so they had no spears to pay. Kings at times gave spears to the 
court pages to enable them marry.
The Zande circumcised their boys.
They also performed dances especially at night during full moon.
Work to do
1. Draw a table like the one below in your notebooks. Write down the 
social, political and economic similarities between the Shilluk and the 
Azande. An example has been given.

The Anywaa people called themselves Anywaa (singular) Anywaae (plural). 
Others, particularly their neighbours simply know them as Anyuak. The 
Anywaa land originally was the stretch of territory extending along the Sobat 
River with its tributaries of Baro, Alworo, Gilo (draining western Ethiopia) and 
Akobo, Oboth, Agwei-Pibor. The Anyuak are part of the Luo Nilotes group. 
They were centralised community. The Anyuak kingdom headquarters is in 
Otalo in Adongo clan.

Source 4
The kingdom of Anyuak was originally divided into two large clans: Tung 
Goc and Tung nyo-Odolla , which were perpetually feuding and competing 
for dominance. The Anyuak settled in big villages along the Akobo, Baro, 
Alworo, Oboth, Agwei and Dikony (Pibor) Rivers. Each Anyuak village has a 
King (Nyiya), chief (kwaro) and Kway-Luak (sub chief) in control of the social 
and administrative matters of the village. The Anyuak society is communal. 
It is obligatory to share resources and assist one another in times of famine 
and diseases. The Anyuak are strongly religious and have strong beliefs in 56spirits.  The Anyuak king (Nyiya) does not die but returns to the river. When 
the King discovers that he can no longer hold on, he secretly whisper to his 
trustees his successor (usually son, brother or a cousin). When the king has 
already returned to the river, the new king is placed on Ocwok (royal throne 
and bead).

The Anyuak kingdom used to be a federation of villages. The village is the 
largest political and economic unit in the Anyuak community. A village 
community is generally associated with lineage of some clans. Each village is 
headed by an independent king or chief. The villages headed by kings (Nyiyae) 
were constantly feuding among themselves for the control of Ocwok (the 
royal throne and bead). This state of insecurity prompted the British colonial 
administration to make Nyiya Agada Akway Cham king of kings ostensibly 
after the Ethiopian feudal system (Emperor Haile Sellasie was king of kings) 
rendering the Ocwok to permanently remain in his possession. All other kings 
come to his court to be put on Ocwok or enthroned.
Economic Organisation
1.  Lying in the plains below the Ethiopian highlands, Anywaa land has the 
characteristics of marsh land, rich savannah forest and grassland with 
annual rainfall of about 800mm. This has tremendous influence on the 
economy and lifestyle of Anywaa people.
2.  They are predominantly subsistence agriculturalists growing sorghum, 
maize, sesame, beans, pumpkin, and tobacco. The raise cattle, goats 
and fowl, which are used for trade and sacrifices to the spirits. The 
cattle raiding practice of their neighbors, has discourage them from 
keeping large herds of cattle.573.  Anywaa-land has a huge potential in wildlife especially large game such 
as elephants, giraffes, buffaloes, etc. The annual migration of the white 
ear cobs pass through Anywaa-land, which become a yearly source of 
proteins but has a huge potential for tourist attraction. There is also a 
potential for exploiting the shea nuts, acacia Senegalese (gum Arabia) 
and lalob which are abound in the forest.
4.  The practice fishing in the following Rivers: Akobo, Baro, Gilo, Alworo, 
Oboth, Agwei, and Dikony (Pibor).
5.  They practice blacksmith to make, fishing spear, hunting spear (fighting 
spear), knives, cultivating tools and dancing tools (gaari).
6.  The Anywaa youth extract gold nuggets and dust from the streams that 
drain the western Ethiopian highlands near Dima and Maji. The gold 
extracted is used for trade with Ethiopian highlanders or exchanged for 
dimuy-beads as well as settling marriages.
Social Organisation
1.  The Anyuak are strongly religious and have strong beliefs in spirits. 
They belief that when one dies his or her spirit comes back. One could 
communicate with the departed through a medium. Anyuak attach 
importance to Acieni  (curse) or gieth  (blessing). The two create order 
in Anyuak society. For instance, before a person dies, he confides their 
will to somebody, who declares himself as the trustee of the will once 
the death is announced. 
2.  Marriage is expected of every adolescent. He pays bride price in 
demuy, cattle and sometimes money. The tradition of money started 
with the Ethiopian Anyuak and has now become common due to the 
scarcity of the demuy.
3.  Marriage to blood relatives is highly discouraged such that the social 
stigma can force one to find ease by going to live in a far off place.
4.  They are polygamous. The Anyuak participate in the marriage of more 
than one wife. This is see as a mode of continuing the community.585.  The Anyuak have typical naming system. The first born is called Omot 
(boy) or Amot (girl), the second born is called Ojulo (boy) or Ajulo (girl) 
the third born is called Obang (boy) or Abang (girl). The twin Opiew 
(boy) and Apiew, Ochan (girl). A child born after twins is called Okello 
(boy) or Akello (girl). A child whose father dies before he or she was 
born is called Agawa (both boys and girls). Ochalla (boy) or Achalla 
(girl) is a child born for a dead brother.
6.  The Anyuak literature is orally expressed in form of poems, songs, 
folktales, riddles, and stories. These are passed down from one  generation 
to another.
7.  The main music instruments included used by the Anyuak include; 
thom (guitar), bul (drum), tung (horn), odola (small drum).

They live in the upper Nile valley. They are Nilotes. The Nuer people were a 
decentralised society. They are believed to be related to the Dinka by blood. 
Some people claim that in the past the descendants of the Nuer and Dinka 
were children of the same father.

Economic organisation
1. They were nomadic pastoralists. Cattle were their dearest possessions. 
A family’s prestige was equivalent to the number of cattle they owned. 
Families lived around communal cattle camps. They preferred being 
named after their cattle. They dedicated their cattle to spirits. 
2. They raided cattle from their neighbours especially the Dinka. To them 
raiding the Dinka was normal and a duty. Every Nuer tribe raided the 
Dinka. 
3.  Women performed rituals to bless men before raids and safe return. 
4. They fished in the Nile River. 
5. They cultivated millet and maize. 
6. The Nuer were traders. They traded with the Dinka, Anyuak and 
the Shilluk who were their 
neighbours.
Social organisation
1. They believed in a supreme 
god called Kwoth. They 
offered sacrifices to him. They 
believed that God visited men 
through natural things like rain 
or thunder, the moon or the 
sun. They believed the rainbow 
is the necklace of God. 
2. They had religious leaders like diviners and healers. 
3. They believed in spirits.
 The spirits of  the air were the most powerful.
4. Facial markings were done to initiate one into adulthood. The cuttings 
are known as Gaar . The patterns differed according to the tribe one 
belonged to. In some it involved six cuts across the forehead.
5. They built circular houses with mud walls. 
6. They had many ceremonial rituals. 
7. Their marriages took place in stages. A marriage was not complete until 
a woman bore at least two children. Then it was fully complete after she 
bore the third child. 
Fig. 3.5 Nuer woman618. Their marriages were polygamous. They were also exogamous. A man 
could not marry a woman of the same clan as his. They also had ‘ghost’ 
marriages.
9. Barren women were allowed to “take a wife” of their own. The children born 
from such a marriage were hers though they had been fathered by men. 
10. They practised circumcision of their males though not all the time. 
They used to circumcise at times as a ritual to cleanse someone who 
has committed incest.
11. Members of a clan shared a totem.

They are the largest ethnic group in South Sudan. They also call themselves 
the Jieng . They are River Lake Nilotes. They are among the tallest people in 
the world.
Political organisation
They were a decentralised community organised in clans. They had leaders 
from ruling families who ruled over the people. These leaders were ritual 
chiefs who were believed to have healing powers. They were known as Beny  
Bith  or masters of fishing. 
Men who had undergone scarification became known as Parapuol  and 
formed the warriors of the community.

2. Dinka women weaved baskets and sleeping mats from papyrus.
3. They made pots and leather belts from animal skin.
4. They were pastoralists. They kept large herds of cattle.
5. They were also traders.They traded with the Nuer in cattle, grain and 
ivory.62

Social organisation
Young men were inducted into adulthood through markings on their forehead.  
This is called scarification  or tattooing . This was done from the ages of 
10 to 16. Those who screamed or blinked during 
scarification were considered weak.
After their scarification they named themselves after 
the colours of their cattle.
They held traditional dances for various occasions 
like marriage.
They practised wrestling which was a very popular 
sport.
Polygamy was practised especially among the rich. 
Women were valued very much as sources of wealth 
through bride price. 
They built round mud huts.
They mostly walked naked especially the men. Women dressed skimpily in 
small goat skin skirts.
The Western Dinka practised circumcision while many Eastern Dinka did 
not.

MAHDISTS IN SUDAN
Introduction
In 1820,Egypt’s ruler Muhammad Ali, invaded Sudan with an army that 
had cannons. He conquered the country and joined it to Egypt. Thus, 
beginning the period of Turko-Egyptian Rule in Sudan, which lasted until 
1885.
Muhammad founded the city of Khartoum and established a governor 
there to rule the Sudanese.
Muhammad Ali extended the empire all the way to Central Africa and 
included almost the whole of the Nile Valley.
This period of Egyptian rule in the entire Sudan region was called the 
‘Turkiya’ because officially Egypt was part of the Turkish Empire.

The region of modern time Sudan has a history linked with or influenced 
by Egypt which is its immediate neighbour to the north. It also has a strong 
identity as the eastern end of the great trade route stretching along the 
open Savannah south of the Sahara. It is important to note that Egypt was 
conquered by the Ottoman Empire (Turkish Empire) in 1517 following the 
Ottoman-Mamluk war of 1516 to 1517. Egypt was administered as a province 
of the Ottoman Empire from 1517 until 1867 hence the name Turko-Egyptian. 
Egypt became a semi-autonomous Ottoman province until the invasion by 
European countries of France and later Britain.
Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan was between 1820 and 1885. Muhammad Ali, 
the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt annexed the country and his grandson Khedive 
Ismail completed this process of annexation.b.68Reasons for the Turko-Egyptian entry into Sudan
There are several reasons for the entry of the Turko-Egyptians into Sudan:
1. The main motive  was to obtain slaves for a new army. Muhammad Ali 
wanted to rebuild his army with slaves from Sudan because he believed 
that a slave army will be loyal to him.
2. He wanted to expand his territory . Muhammad Ali harboured 
ambitions of finding an empire. This army of slaves would therefore be 
useful for the expansion of his territory. Muhammad Ali was interested 
in slaves whom he wanted to train into a modern army. He collected 
as many slaves as possible from South Sudan and sent them to Aswan 
for training. Those who were unfit for military services were put to 
work in his many agricultural and industrial projects. Between 1820 
and 1821 for example, it is estimated that about 30,000 Sudanese were 
conscripted and sent to Egypt for training into the army. Many died 
because of diseases and unfamiliar climate.
3. Turko-Egyptian invasion of Sudan was also motivated by the need to 
find new sources of  revenue to finance his projects in Egypt . 
Muhammad Ali craved for wealth and markets. He therefore invaded 
Sudan looking for commodities of interest such as slaves, gold, ivory 
and timber. South Sudan and her people became the main sources of 
these commodities. Egyptian soldiers destroyed pyramids looking for 
gold, ivory and slaves. Many Sudanese fled to escape slave traders. 
4. Muhammad Ali wanted to crush the survivors of  the Mamluk  
massacre who had established themselves at Dongola. This dates back 
to the time when he was appointed as the viceroy. He made his way 
up by forming alliances with one set of 
potential opponents against others and 
eliminating one group after the other in 
turn. His main obstacle was the Mamluks 
who were descendants of slave warriors 
from abroad. Muhammad Ali invited 
about 5,000 Mamluks notables in the 
citadel treating them to coffee and polite 
conversation. His soldiers opened fire and 
murdered all of them. Muhammad Ali 
continued to hunt down and kill Mamluks 
 Fig. 4.1 Muhammad Ali69in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt totaling to about 3,000. Many of them 
fled to the south and established a state at Dongola (Dungulah) as a 
base for their slave trading.
The major aim for the establishment of Turko-Egyptian Rule in larger Sudan was 
to obtain black slaves for the Turkish army in Egypt.
Note!!!
The conquest of  Sudan
Ismil Kamil, first conquered the people of Nubia, Sennas, Kordofan and the 
Root sea. The Sudanese Kingdoms were conquered very fast. This is because 
they had inferior weapons compared to Egyptians. The Funj Kingdom and 
the Kordofan Kingdom were both conquered in 1895.

Sudan.
3. Present your findings in class.70Activity 2  Turko-Egyptians administrative 
structures in Sudan
Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan lasted for 
a period of about 60 years. The Sudan 
territories that initially consisted of 
kingdoms and tribal territories were put 
under one centralised administration. 
Nothern Sudan was divided into 6 
provinces. A governor general who 
was answerable to Cairo headed this 
centralised bureaucracy. During this 
period, Sudan was ruled by Turkish 
speaking elites and those they appointed. Top ranks in the army were 
meant for Turkish speaking Egyptians, while the South Sudanese provided 
slaves. Egyptian soldiers lived well and overtaxed the people. Muhammad 
Ali won allegiance of some tribal and religious leaders by granting them tax 
exemptions. 
Egyptians divided Sudan into provinces, which were further sub-divided into 
smaller administrative units that were based on tribal territories. Khartoum 
became the centre of Egyptian domain and served as a residence of the 
Egyptian deputy. Garrison towns became administrative centres. At local 
level, traditional chiefs assumed administrative responsibility. These changes 
increased tension that already existed between the centre and periphery 
especially the south. The seat of power moved to the central part, that is 
Khartoum. Slave trade enhanced the position of these northerners yet slaves 
came from the south. The Turko-Egyptians and north Sudanese collaborated 
against those of the south and exploited them into slavery.
The centralised government introduced by Muhammad was only used in North 
Sudan and among the Shilluk.

‘Ali Khurshid was given wide powers, but discovered his new domain was 
already in ruins after only five years of Turko-Egyptian rule. The hikimdar’s 
rule, which lasted until 1838, was characterized by a number of important 
developments, including the establishment of Khartoum as the new capital of 
the Sudan, the introduction of a number of new crops, the growing cultivation 
of cotton, and the revival of the Gezira region. ‘Ali Khurshid also worked hard 
at organising the slave trade, and mounted numerous raids on the Shilluk, the 
Dinkas, and the Hadendowa, many of which met fierce resistance.
(Hill 1959; Udal 1998; Douin 1944)
There were several reasons that contributed to the collapse of the
Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan. These reasons were:
Pair work
From the source above, discuss the key points that made the Turko-Egyptian 
rule collapse?
1. Poor leadership
 As the Egyptian rule became more secure, government became less 
harsh. There was burdensome bureaucracy that was put in place that 
was expected to make the country self-supporting. Muhammad Ali’s 
immediate successors Abbas (1849 to 1854) and Said (1854 to 1863) 
lacked leadership qualities and paid little attention to Sudan.
2. Activities in the Ottoman Empire where slaves were mistreated
 Activities in the Ottoman Empire also contributed to the collapse of 72Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan. In 1865, the Ottoman Empire ceded the 
Red Sea coast and its ports to Egypt. Ismail made the Europeans provincial 
governors and appointed Sudanese to more important government 
positions. He attempted to eliminate slave trade. He made attempts to 
build a new army based on the European model instead of depending 
on slaves. This modernisation caused a lot of unrest and contributed to 
the collapse of the Turko-Egyptian rule. The army revolted (mutiny) and 
many Sudanese resented getting of troops among the civilian population.
3. There was resentment of the use of Sudanese labour on public 
projects
 Efforts to suppress slave trade angered the urban merchant class who 
had grown prosperous by selling slaves.
4.  The killing of an Ethiopian priest
 Another incident that weakened Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan was the 
killing of an Ethiopian priest in Sudan by Egyptian tax collectors in 1837. 
This incident prompted the Ethiopians to send a large force of about 
20,000 soldiers and defeated the Egyptians in Sudan.
5.  Tension between traders and soldiers in the empire 
 Egyptian rule in Sudan was undermined due to hostility and tension 
between the traders and soldiers that arose due to commercial expeditions 
organised by traders and missionaries to exploit natural and human 
resources in South Sudan. This hostility and tension increased violent 
confrontation since the traders viewed the Sudanese with contempt and 
a negative attitude. They regarded them as racially inferior. The invaders 
resorted to acquiring ivory by force leading to sequences of violence 
and conflict that undermined the Turko-Egyptian rule. As sources of 
commodities such as ivory depleted, the traders relied on intermediaries 
for example, the Bari who demanded higher prices for fewer tasks. All 
this undermined efforts to establish beneficial commercial relationship.  
6. Failure to end slave trade by Turko-Egyptian rulers 
 Attempts made by leaders such as Viceroy Muhammad Said, Khedive 
Ismail, Sir Samuel Baker and others to suppress slave trade also 
undermined Turko-Egyptian rule in South Sudan. The leaders imposed 
heavy taxes on traders’ employees in a bid to suppress the slave trade. 
Muhammad Ismail and Sir Samuel Baker even sent expeditions to South 73Sudan to extend Khedive’s rule there and suppress the trade but the 
expeditions failed. These revolts led to Sultan Abdal Hamud replacing 
Ismail. Gordon resigned as governor general of Sudan and was succeeded 
by Muhammad Rauf Pasha.
7.  The Mahdist Revolution 
 The Mahdist war of 1881 to 1899 also led to the collapse of the Turko-
Egyptian rule in Sudan. This was a revolt led by the Sudanese religious 
leader, Muhammad bin Abdullah who proclaimed himself the “Mahdi” or 
guided one. The war which shall be described later on in this unit, led to 
the decline of Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan.
8. British invasion  of Egypt in 1889 making Egypt their protectorate led 
to the collapse of Turko-Egyptian rule. During this period, Khedive 
Ismail had put Egypt into a huge debt due to his exorbitant spending 
and corruption. This made his financing of the Suez Canal to crumble 
forcing Britain to step in as the Suez Canal was of paramount strategic 
importance to British imperial interests. Britain and Egypt therefore 
occupied Sudan as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
Sudanese response to the Turko-Egyptian rule
People of Sudan have been oppressed by different regimes that ruled 
the Sudan. Turko-Egyptian occupation was promoted by expansionist 
ambitions of the Ottoman Empire and it’s craving for wealth and markets. 
The commodities were slaves, ivory, gold and timber found in South Sudan. 
Turko-Egyptians and the North Sudanese collaborated in their raids against 
South Sudan for slaves. Many South Sudanese were taken into slavery in the 
Arab world and the new world. After consolidating their control over north 
Sudan, Egyptian forces began to move south. The South Sudanese resisted 
Turko-Egyptian invasion. Egyptian forces attempted to set up forts and 
garrison in the region but diseases and defections forced their abandonment. 
This is because the Turko-Egyptians were not familiar with the climate. The 
Khedives of Egypt had no real authority over the region. 
Arab invaders who wanted to impose their culture and way of life on the 
people frequently bypassed villages in South Sudan. Many local rulers 
despised the Arab culture and encouraged the tribes to resist the invaders 
and protect their African culture and way of life. The invaders were met with 
stiff resistance.74Activity 3  Mahdist Revolution (1881 to 1889)

2. Give reasons why you think it was necessary for South Sudanese to

The Mahdist war, as stated earlier in this 
unit was a war fought between the Mahdist 
Sudanese religious leader, Muhammad 
Ahmad bin Abdullah, who was the 
proclaimed “Mahdi” of Islam (the guided 
one) and forces of Khedive of Egypt 
initially and later the British. Muhammad 
Ahmad was the son of a Dongola boat 
builder. He spent several years in seclusion 
and gained reputation as a teacher. 
Fig. 4.3: Muhammad Ahmed bin 
Abdullah (the Mahdiya)75The Suez Canal was opened in Egypt in 1869 increasing immensely Egypt’s 
economic and strategic importance. Many European imperialists became 
attracted to the region. During this time around 1879, Ismail Pasha’s 
government was replaced by his son Tewfik Pasha as the ruler of Egypt. 
Ismail’s government had incurred huge external debts for Egypt due to 
poor spending bureaucracy and corruption. He was unable to sustain the 
construction of the Suez Canal and so Tewfik who ascended to power at 
the hands of foreign powers replaced him. Tewfik yearned to get British 
occupation to secure the monarchy. 
Course of  the Mahdist Revolution
Source 4
“Described in secular terms, the Mahdia was a revolt which occurred in 
the Sudanese dependencies of the Khedive of Egypt which overthrew the 
existing administration and which established an indigenous territorial state, 
mainly in northern parts of those dependencies. The consequence of this 
revolt with the establishment of the British control over Egypt itself resulted 
in the confrontation of the Mahdist state with British military power and 
ultimately in its destruction, incidentally to the development of British foreign 
and imperial policy at the end of the nineteenth Century”.
Pair work
1. Draw a frame diagram showing the sequence of events as outlined in the 
source above.
In June 1881, Muhammad Ahmed declared himself the Mahdi of the 
Turkiyya. By January 1883, Kordofan capitulated. Other areas followed suit. 
The most demorolising defeat was at the Battle of Shaykan when 10,000 
Eygptian forces were defeated. From that point, other provinces like Darfur, 
Bahr el-Ghazal started falling. In January 1888, Khartoum fell. This marked 
the end of teh Turkiyya regime.
The Equatorial province under the leadership of Amin Pasha was the only 
province which had fallen under the Mahdiyya rule.76Reasons for the Mahdist Revolution
1. Resentment to the activities of Tewfik by the Sudanese and Egyptians. 
They resented the ever-increasing influence of European governments 
and merchants in the affairs of the country. Heavy presence of 
Europeans in Egypt to protect Cairo, Alexandria and the Suez Canal 
also limited British and Egyptian presence in Sudan. This led to the 
Mahdi, Muhammad bin Abdullah declaring the revolt.
2. The Mahdi war broke out because Abdullah wanted to expel the British 
and overthrow the monarchy, which he viewed, as secular and leaning 
to the west. He wanted to replace it with a pure Islamic government. 
This made him attract the support of many Sudanese people and even 
Egyptians catching Tewfik and the British off guard. 
3. Another reason for the Mahdi revolution was ethnic Sudanese anger 
at the foreign Turkish Ottoman rulers. Muslims were annoyed with the 
Turks lax religious standard and willingness to appoint non-Muslims 
such as Charles Gordon to high positions.
4. Mahdi revolt occurred because, the people of Sudan and segments 
of Egyptians were not happy with perceived corruption and 
mismanagement that characterised Tewfik’s government.
5. The slave traders of South Sudan were also not happy with abolition 
of slave trade, which was one of the main sources of income in Sudan 
at the time. General Charles Gordon initiated an intensified anti slavery 
campaigns. Attempts made by Egyptian and British leaders to suppress 
this trade immensely contributed to the outbreak of the Mahdi revolt.
6. The Mahdi war was caused by the Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan. 
During the Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan and South Sudan, segments 
of the population suffered extreme hardship. There was heavy taxation 
imposed on Sudanese people by the central government. Flat tax was 
imposed on the farmers and small traders and collected by government 
appointed tax collectors from Sha’igiyya tribe of northern Sudan. 
Farmers were many times unable to pay this high tax during times 
of drought and famine. Besides, the tax was collected with brutal and 
unjust methods making many farmers to flee their villages in the fertile 
Nile Valley to the remote areas of Kordofan and Darfur. Turko-Egyptian 
rule saw this masters having absolute control over all Sudanese trade 
and this destroyed livelihoods and indigenous practices. During forceful 
military conscription of slaves to the Egyptian army, thousands of 77Sudanese men and boys died on their long march from the Sudanese 
hinterlands to Aswan, Egypt. 
Reasons why the Mahdist revolution was successful
Source 5
“A revolutionary movement is most likely to be successful when there is a 
general discontent, not confined to one class or territorial group but spread 
throughout the society a; a whole, arising from specific grievances acd not 
merely from a vague malaise or resentment. Secondly, this must coincide 
with a coniousness of material or moral weakness in the existing government, 
which hinders it from crushing the revolution at its outset. Thirdly, there must 
be a revolutionary army of persons ready and able to use force to attain 
their aims. Fourthly, there must be a revolutionary high command fulfilling a 
double function: both of disserninating propaganda which will inflame and 
make articulate the discontent while suggesting a renewed social and political 
order, and of organising revolutionary activities evoked by this propaganda.” 
(Holt: Mahdist State.) 
Individual work
1. Briefly summarise in bullet point the author’s view about the factors 
necessary for a  revolutionary movement to succeed.
The Mahdist revolution scored success after another even though its 
supporters possessed traditional weapons compared to the government’s 
modern and sophisticated weapons.
There are several reasons that contributed to the success of the Mahdi revolt. 
These were:
1. Many Arab tribes rose in support of the revolt as they considered it a 
Jihad (religious war) against Turkish oppressors. 78Source 6
Pair work
 What  do you think is the main message in this  modern day cartoon 
strip. Discuss with your friend. 
2. Religion motivated people to join the movement. Abdallah (Mahdi) 
legitimised the revolt by drawing parallels to the life of the prophet 
Muhammad. For example, he called his followers “ Ansar ” after the 
people who greeted Prophet Muhammad in Madina. He also appointed 
commanders to represent three of the four religious Caliphs. He 
announced that Abdullahi bin Muhammad, his eventual successor, 
represented Abu Bakri Al Sidiq, the prophet’s successor. He collected 
zakat (tax on wealth) instead of the range of colonial taxes. He strove to 
impose Sharia prohibitions and punishments. 
3. The Mahdi rebels had vast stores of arms and ammunition, military 
clothing and other supplies captured from their battles. The Mahdi 
waged several successful battles against the Egyptians. For example, 
the Mahdi had a well-organised army compared to the Egyptian army. 
In the summer of 1883, the Egyptian troops that encountered the rebels 
were disorganised. The force was placed under the command of a retired 
British Indian staff corps officer William Hicks and twelve European 
officers. The force was in the words of Winston Churchill “perhaps the 79worst army that has ever marched to war” as it was unpaid, untrained 
and undisciplined. 
4. Internal problems in Egypt. Egypt was groaning under a huge debt. The 
British under the control of a “Financial Advisor” placed the Egyptian 
treasury crippled by corruption and bureaucracy. This office in a bid 
to regulate Egypt’s financial affairs maintained that the garrisons in 
Sudan were costing the Egyptian government unmaintainable expense. 
It was therefore decided that Egyptian presence in the Sudan should be 
withdrawn and the country left to some form of self-government likely 
headed by the Mahdi.
 There was also a revolution going on in Egypt (Urdbi Revolt) at the same 
time. Therefore Kheedive of Egypt refused to send troops to Sudan.
Activity 4  Mahdist administration
The Mahdiya (Mahdist regime) imposed 
traditional Islamic laws (Sharia laws). 
This, according to Muhammad Ahmed, 
would promote religious unity unlike the 
old order which was believed to promote 
tribalism. The Mahdi maintained that his 
movement was not a religious order but a 
universal regime. To him, this was a genuine 
Sudanese nationalist government. Initially, 
the Mahdiya (Mahdi state) functioned as a 
Jihad state run like a military camp. After 
the death of Muhammad Ahmed on 22nd 
June 1885 due to typhus, the state fell in 
the hands of Khalifa Abdullahi. The Khalifa instituted an administration and 
appointed “Ansar” (usually Baqqara) as emirs of the provinces he established 
in his kingdom. He established the military and organised workshops 
to manufacture ammunition and maintain steamboats. There existed a 
department of finance or treasury which kept detailed records, taxed the 
subjects and distributed wealth. The state minted its own coins for the local 
economy.
At the top of the Mahdist administration was the Khalifa. He often delegated 
his authority to his brother who commanded the largest division within the 
Fig. 4.4 Khalifa Abdullahi80Mahdi army, the Black Standard. The army (Black Standard) was divided into 
four divisions led by a Chief Officer (Amir) who oversaw a number of smaller 
units organised by tribal clan, ethnic or other affiliation. These units were 
divided into groups of 100 which were further divided into groups of 25. 
At every level of command, authority was derived from pre-existing social 
hierarchies, tribal clans or family leaders. These leaders had several functions 
including settling disputes , overseeing matters of  public health  and 
sanitation , mobilising people for communal labour projects  and 
explaining directives by the Khalifa .
There existed courts administered through the Sharia law. The main court was 
located at the mosque headed by a chief judge. A number of smaller courts 
existed to listen to cases involving inheritance, taxation and slave ownership 
among others. Much of the wealth of the Mahdist elite was dependant on 
labour of their slaves. Most of these slaves were drawn from the non Arabic, 
non Muslim people of the South Sudan identified by the Ansars as “Blacks.” 
South Sudanese slave labour often taken by force formed the productive base 
of the society. Families of the elite Mahdist could possess up to 100 slaves. 
Slave soldiers performed several functions such as guards and labourers at 
the Khalifa house.

“the Mahdist movement was short-lived, and in the long run, unsuccessful, 
but its history of less than twenty years shows a rapid political development

He used the Jihad to extend his version of Islam in the region. As stated earlier, 81the initial Mahdiya state was run on military lines with courts enforcing the 
Sharia law. 
Later, the Khalifa established a more traditional administration. He continued 
his invasion of neighbouring areas invading Ethiopia and defeating them in 
March 1889, where the Ethiopian emperor Yohannes IV was killed. These 
invasions strained his state economically. This coupled with crop failure 
weakened by the Mahdiyya. 
He was also unable to overcome tribal leanings to unify Sudan in as much as 
he was an able general and administrator. 
Many times he was forced to employ Egyptians to provide the trained 
administration and technicians he needed to maintain his self proclaimed 
Islamist military caliphate. 
His state was also threatened by the Italian, French and British imperial forces 
that surrounded it. 
In September 1896, Khalifa 
Abdullahi lost Dongola. In 
1898, in the Battle of Atbara 
River, his army was defeated 
and he moved his new capital 
to Omdurman, his army 
was destroyed by the Anglo 
Egyptian forces, forcing the 
Khalifa to flee to the south. He 
was finally caught and killed by 
Sir Reginald Wingate.

AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES IN 
ACHIEVING INDEPENDENCE AND 
DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA
Regional bodies are organisations formed by different countries in one 
region to achieve certain objectives. In Africa such bodies include: The 
East African Community (EAC), which operates in countries in the Great 
Lake regions of Eastern Africa, The Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) that operates in West Africa and the Common Market 
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).  These regional organisations 
operate under the blessings of the African Union, which encourages their 
formation. Internationally, the African Union is also a regional organisation 
representing the African region or the African continent. We also have 
regional organisations in other continents like Europe. An example is the 
European Union (EU) made up of many nations in the continent of Europe.
International organisations operate in many different countries across the 
continents. They include the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the 
World Bank.
In this unit, we shall look at various regional and international organisations, 
their structure, aims and contributions to the achievement of independence 
and development in Africa.Unit 
584Activity 1  The Organisation of  African Unity (OAU)
This was an organisation formed by independent African countries in 1963. 
It owes its origin to Pan-Africanism.

1. Study the charter of the OAU. Using magazine cutouts , library or other 
resources.
2. Briefly summarise the OAU’s purposes, principles and structure. “The 
OAU was formed as African leaders recognised that they would have to 
help themselves if African nations were to make real progress.” Do you 
think this is true? Give reasons for your answer.
Objectives of  the OAU
1. To provide African countries with a permanent organisation through 
which they could discuss issues affecting them and come up with ways 
of solving them.
2. To provide identity for the newly independent countries of Africa in a 
world dominated and controlled by the white race. 
3. To eradicate all forms of colonialism from Africa.  
4. To improve the living standards and conditions of African people as a 
group and as individual states. 
5. To help maintain the sovereignty of African countries.
6. To promote cooperation among the African states in economic, social 
and political fields so as to improve living standards. 
7. To promote African unity.86The birth of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) more than 50 years ago in 
Addis Ababa emerged from the aspiration towards an ideal of unity advocated 
by the fathers of independence. From 22nd to 25th May 1963, 30 African countries 
took part in the conference in the Ethiopian capital, which set up the OAU, which 
marked the arrival of the first pan-African organisation. A charter defined its 
objectives, principles and institutions.

Activity 8  How regional and international 
organisations helped in the gaining of 
independence in Africa
One international organisation that we have not discussed above is the United 
Nations which was formed in 1945. Together with the organisation of African 
Unity, the United Nations has played a great role in freeing African nations 
from colonisation.96The United Nations
The United Nations in its charter on human rights included the right to
self-determination. This means that all people have a right to decide their 
destiny for themselves and not other people deciding for them. Colonised 
people had the right to be set free so that they rule themselves. The UN also 
set up the trusteeship system and the trusteeship council. This council was 
to organise the administration of territories that were not independent. Any 
country that took over the administration of such a territory was to set up 
systems that would slowly lead it to self- independence.
In 1960, the General Assembly of the UN adopted the Declaration of granting 
independence to colonised countries and people. In it, it insisted that all people 
have the right to self-determination  and colonialism should end quickly. 
All of its member countries, some which had colonies, were to obey this. In 
1962 it adopted the special committee on decolonization to monitor if the 
colonialists were doing what it asked them to do in the previous declaration. 
Through this special units it condemned colonisation and removed Africa 
from the claws of colonialism. When South Africa wanted to annex Namibia, 
it saved it from annexation. When the White extremists in Southern Rhodesia 
(Zimbabwe) did not want to give independence to the Africans there, the 
UN put sanctions on the government of Ian Smith to force it to give them 
independence. It consistently condemned apartheid regime in South Africa. 
The OAU on the other hand had a special committee as part of its structure 
dedicated to freeing Africans from colonialism. It was called the Liberation 
Committee. Its full title was the Coordinating Committee for the Liberation 
Movements in Africa. It had its headquarters in Dar-es-Salaam.
Group work
a) Carry out a research on the African organisations which helped 
South Sudan gain her independence.
b) Write down the contributions made by these organisations and the 
challenges they faced in helping South Sudan become an independent 
country.
c) Present your findings to your class.97How regional and international organisations help in 
developing Africa

“We further hope that this coming together will evolve eventually into a 
Union of African States just as the original thirteen American colonies 
developed into the forty-nine States constituting the American community. 
We are convinced that it is only in the - interdependence of such a unity 
that we shall be able truly to safeguard our individual national freedom. 
We have no illusions about this being an easy task. But with the spirit and 
determination there, the goodwill and cooperation of our people, we shall, 
I am firmly convinced, reach our objective”. (A speech by Kwame Nkurumah, 
former president of Ghana)
Pair work
To what extent do you think the above statement has been achieved?
1. The OAU helped in solving disputes between countries like Kenya and 
Somalia over their boundary, Ethiopia and Somalia over the Ogaden 
region, Chad and Libya too. The disputes were solved by the OAU’s 
Mediation Commission. IGAD and the AU have been involved in peace 
keeping missions in the horn of Africa and other areas of Africa. This 
helped promote peace which is a key development.
2. The OAU and other regional organisations have banks where nations 
get loans to develop their countries. An example of this is the African 
Development Bank, the African Central Bank, the African Monetary 
Fund and the African Investment Bank. 
3. The United Nations organisation through the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund have helped balance trade between 
nations in Africa and stabilise their currencies. They too have given 
loans and grants to counties in Africa to build infrastructure, pay debts 
and so on.
4. The East African Community and ECOWAS have pooled resources 
together to build roads and railways.
5. Organisations like COMESA and EAC have promoted trade in Africa 98between member countries through reduction of tariffs. For example, 
Nigeria supplies oil to members of ECOWAS at a cheaper price.
6. The African Union through its peer review mechanism has promoted 
good governance in Africa through positive competition of countries. 
Those that promote democracy and gender equality are awarded. The 
AU and the UN also send observer missions to African countries to 
observe elections to help ensure free and fair elections. 
7.  ECOWAS has allowed free movement of members in each other’s 
countries. It has reduced restrictions on VISA requirements. This has 
allowed a lot of cross border investments.
8. The EU and African countries co-operate in many ways. The EU has 
entered agreements with many African countries like the Cotonou 
Agreement and the joint Africa-EU Strategy of 2007. The EU adopted 
three special strategies for three areas in Africa – the horn of Africa, 
the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahel region. In the horn of Africa, it helps 
countries fight insecurity especially terrorism, drought, famine and 
flooding. It gives food aid and teaches communities on how to develop 
sustainable economies. In the Sahel region and the Gulf of Guinea, it 
is involved in promoting security too. It fights human trafficking in the 
Sahel region. In 2017, the EU committed to provide 50 million Euros to 
support the newly established G5 Sahel joint force to improve security 
in the region.
 In other parts of Africa, it has had several military and civilian missions 
as part of its common security and defence policy. EU missions are 
deployed in the Central Africa Republic, Libya, Mali and Somalia today. 
Here, they prevent civilian deaths and help them go on with their 
economic and social activities thus promoting development. 
 Through economic partnerships with African states the EU promotes 
trade between it and Africa by allowing imports and exports from 
partner countries. The European development fund is used to fund a lot 
of projects in Africa. 
9. The United Nations has helped resettle refugees. It provides food to 
them, security and education. The education helps them get employment 
even in the host countries.99Work to do

Challenges that regional and international organisations face 
when addressing African affairs
Source 6
“A peacekeeping operation, cannot serve as a substitute for the absence of a 
political process. What the peacekeeping operation can only do is to support 
a political process. ”( The Relationship between Africa and the UN FES New 
York Conference Report June 2008)
Pair work
Do you think the statement on page 94 true? What are the dangers of relying 
too heavily on peace keeping operations?
1.  Shortage of funds
Many African regional organisations face this problem as some members 
fail to remit their contributions. This makes it hard to finance their projects. 
2.  Personal conflicts among leaders
Some leaders of certain countries do not meet one on one due to various 
reasons. Some miss crucial meetings because their “enemy” is attending.
3.  Countries going against agreed agreements 
The EAC member states for example have accused one another of doing 100this especially Kenya and Tanzania. This creates hatred and drags any 
development plans.
4.  Some countries go against the spirit of good neighbourliness
One aim of the EAC is to promote good neighbourliness. Kenyan fishermen 
are periodically detained in Uganda accused of fishing in Ugandan waters 
of Migingo Island. In 2017, the Tanzanian government detained livestock 
of Kenyan pastoralists who had crossed the border in search of pasture 
during the dry season. Kenya sent several delegations to plead with 
the Tanzanian government in vain. Such actions create hostility in the 
organisation.
5.
Some international organisations that are in Africa assisting Africans on 
how to develop viable economies in some areas get frustrated as some 
communities refuse to change. Some other communities need constant 
supervision to continue doing what they were told yet it is for their own 
benefit. 
6. 
Some members are involved in creating instability in other member 
nations.
7. 
Civil wars have undermined the progress made in some countries like 
in Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia. Agriculture is disrupted, 
roads destroyed and people killed. A lot of money is spent on weapons 
and reconstruction after war instead of development.
Work to do
Imagine that you are a member of the EAC, write an essay on how you 
would solve the challenges that EAC faces.
Present your essay in class. Let the class question each essay so that as a 
class the suggested solutions are debated upon and a collaborative set of 
solutions are developed. 101NEW WORDS

TRADES
Introduction
Trade is defined as the buying and selling of goods and services. 
Slave trade is the process of procuring, transporting and selling of human 
beings as slaves. South Sudan was from ancient times, involved in trading 
activities.
Apart from the local trade that existed among the South Sudanese 
communities to acquire commodities that they needed, this area was 
also involved extensively in regional and international trade particularly 
in slaves and other commodities. Slavery in the region of South Sudan 
has a long history beginning in the ancient Nubian and ancient Egyptian 
times and continuing up to the present. Prisoners of war were a regular 
occurrence in Africa. During conquests and after winning battles, Nubians 
took Egyptian slaves. Egyptians also took slaves after winning battles with 
the Libyans, Canaanites and Nubians.

Interview with Simon Deng, 
A former domestic slave who 
now lives  in America and talks 
on human rights issues. He is 
also involved in peace and 
reconciliation talks with the people 
in South Sudan. He is a native of 
the Shilluk Kingdom in Southern 
Sudan. Picture: Antoine de Ras, 
10/03/2013
104Johannesburg - His tribal scars are the first thing you notice about Simon 
Deng.
He sits suited and collared and tied - a small blue pin on his lapel reading, 
“Freedom is not free.”
But it’s the line of scar tissue - 20 or so bumps stretching across his brow, 
from ear to ear - that catch the eye.
The first thing he did after escaping slavery was to have the markings of 
South Sudan’s Shilluk tribe cut into his flesh.
“For all those years that I was a slave, the dog lived better than I did,” he says.
“My slave master told me that to be treated like a human being, I must do 
three things: convert to Islam, take an Arab name and become their son. To 
give up my identity. Now, nobody can take my identity away.”
Deng was nine when he was abducted, put on a boat going up the Nile and 
given to a northern Sudanese family as a “gift.”
For the next three-and-a-half years, he was the family’s beast of burden, 
doing chores, walking to and from the river carrying water.
“I was made to do things a child cannot do physically. It wasn’t easy, but did 
I have a choice? I was punished if I did not fulfil all my tasks.”
He was beaten, bullied and threatened. Run away and your legs will be cut 
off, he was told.
It’s difficult to imagine now. Deng sits in the restaurant of an upmarket hotel, 
pouring warm milk into his coffee - an award-winning abolitionist activist 
travelling the world to share his message that slavery is not history; that it is 
happening now.
But it was only after 20 years of freedom that Deng began to speak up.
For former slaves, speaking about their ordeal is taboo - shameful, says Deng. 
Even when he became a Sudanese long-distance swimming champion, he 
kept his experiences to himself.
But in 1993, having relocated to the US, he read a newspaper article that 
brought back the pain of his childhood.
“It said in Sudan you could buy a human being for $10. I could not believe 
what I saw. For three nights I couldn’t sleep. It haunted me. These were my 
people. This was my country. This was the very situation I had walked away 
from. But I was living in denial.”
Deng organised several walks across the US to raise awareness about slavery 
in his country and to push for the independence of South Sudan.
“To look back and see where I am now, I consider myself a lucky victim. So 105many kids like me who went through what I went through will never have 
this opportunity, to go all over the world and speak to free people as a free 
person. I have a moral obligation to speak out on behalf of those who can’t 
speak for themselves.”
It is a moral obligation that extends to countries with clout, he says. Countries 
like South Africa.
South Sudan gained independence in July 2011, yet the fighting between 
north and south persists.
“The AU is always sitting down to discuss Sudan - but the solutions do not 
materialise. Africa needs a fatherhead to look up to and South Africa is in a 
position to play that role. If South African leaders turn a blind eye to a child 
calling for help, that itself is immoral.”
South Africa has forces in Darfur, western Sudan, as part of the UN-AU 
operations in the region.
For Deng, freedom came in the form of the same tribal marks he now bears. 
Sent to market one day, he saw three men with the scars he’d seen back home.
“It was like the sun rising out from nowhere,” he says.
He approached the men, spilled out his story, his name, the names of his 
parents, his village, his tribe, speaking in his native tongue to convince them 
he was one of them. They knew somebody from the same village. Over the 
next few weeks, Deng’s escape was plotted.
Then, suddenly, he was on a steamer heading south and standing outside 
his mother’s hut and his sister was screaming and his mother was crying 
and the son they thought was long dead - the son who had been missing for 
three-and-a-half years, whose father had offered a reward of 10 cows for 
information on - was home.
Deng is still based in the US, but travels to South Sudan as often as he can. As 
for the north? “Never,” he says.
But that’s the point, having that choice.
“There was a time when I couldn’t say no, when all I knew was yes - and yes 
to everything. Now, without fear of torture or punishment, I can choose. I can 
say no. I am a free man.”
 * For every 1,000 people in Africa, four will be pushed into modern-day 
slavery.
According to the International Labour Organisation, an estimated 20.9 
million people around the world were victims of forced labour between 2002 
and 2011.106Of these, 4.5 million were victims of forced sexual exploitation, while 
14.2 million were forced into economic activities of the kind Simon Deng 
experienced, like agriculture, construction, domestic work and manufacturing. 
Ten percent were at the mercy of state entities, like prisons or the army or 
rebel forces.
More than half the victims were women and girls, and a quarter were children 
under the age of 17. Most of these victims were found in Asia, but in an 
unwelcome second place - with 3.7 million people in forced labour - was 
Africa.

1. Assume that you are a committee addressing modern-day slavery, 
which laws can you come up with that are going to prevent slavery 
today?
2. Why do former slaves like Deng find it a taboo to talk about their ordeal?  
Arabs conquered Egypt and attempted to conquer the kingdoms of Christian 
Nubian (Sudan) on several occasions without success. Given their unsuccessful 
efforts, the Arabs signed the 600 year ‘ treaty of  Bagt ’ in 652 AD with the 
Christian Nubian kingdom of Makuria. Nubians who were already involved 
in the East African slave trade agreed to trade 360 slaves annually to their 
northern neighbours in exchange for spices and grains. The Nubian kingdom 
fell in 1504. The Ottoman conquered most of Nubia (Sudan) while the Funj 
conquered much of modern day Sudan from Khartoum to Darfur. The Funj 
began to use slaves in the army during the reign of Badi (1692 to 1711). 
Egyptian slave traders began raiding modern South Sudan. Muhammad Ali 
of Egypt attempted to build up an army of South Sudanese slaves with the 
aid of the Nubian slave traders. 
During the Trans-Saharan trade, the main item of trade from North Africa 
(Sudan region) was salt which was the main trade commodity needed in 
Sudan. This is because people living near the Sea could only obtain salt. Other 
items of trade from North Africa were clothes, beads and metal goods. On 
the other hand, the item of trade from West Africa to North Africa was gold. 
There was a high demand of gold in North Africa and this was available in 107West Africa. Other items of trade were slaves and ivory. Slaves were acquired 
from African communities in the South Sudan region and not the Arabs of 
North Sudan. Slave raids became a common occurrence in this region. There 
were slave traders who organised and captured slaves from the interior of 
Sudan.  
Read the following exerpt, then answer the following questions.
Samuel Baker, a British explorer visited Khartoum in 1862 said, “Slave trade 
was the industry that kept Khartoum 
going as a bustling town” An armed 
group would sail up the Nile, find a 
convenient African village, surround 
it during the night and attack just 
before dawn, burning huts and 
shooting. Women and young adults 
would be captured and bound with 
“forked poles on their shoulders,” 
hands tied to the pole in front, 
children bound to their mothers. 
The motive according to him was 
“to render the village so poor that surviving inhabitants would be forced to 
collaborate with slavers on their next excursion against neighboring villages.” 
The villages would be looted of cattle, grain ivory and totally destroyed.” 
According to the historian Douglas H Johnson, two thirds of Khartoum’s 
population was slaves. The Arab African slave trade continued and still 
continues, because according to Muslims, slavery is clearly sanctioned in the 
Koran (Holy book of Muslims). The Koran condones slavery especially of 
non believers.

Trade routes in the slavery trade
Pair work
Analyse the trade routes that were used by slave traders giving reasons 
why they prefered those routes.
North Africa was central to the entire trade of the Mediterranean region. 
Nubia in Sudan likewise traded with interior African countries such as, Chad, 
Libya and the Arabian Peninsula. On the east coast of the continent, the 
Swahili traders linked the region to the Indian Ocean trading network bringing 
imports from China, India and far East countries. These imports included 
utensils, clothes, porcelain plates in exchange for gold, ivory and slaves. In 
the interior of African continent, trade was limited due to low population 
densities. Between 1000 and 1500, the forests of West Africa became part of 
the trading network. The trade routes involved towns such as, Ife to Djenne, a 
major trading centre in Sudan near other large trade cities such as Timbuktu 
and Gao.
By 1000 AD, the Bantu language speaking people of Zimbabwe and southern 
Africa developed extensive overseas trade with lands as far away as China 
and India. They traded beef, iron, ivory and gold in exchange for porcelain 
beads, Persian and Arab pots. Trade in the forest kingdoms was mostly done 
at local levels in markets. Clothes, vegetables, meat and other items were 
traded and paid for using seashells called collieries which were imported 
from East Africa. Copper and iron bars were also used as currency. Trade 
with the Middle East had began quite early with the ancient Egypt. The 
spread of Islam brought traders into the interior of Africa. This laid down the 109framework for Long Distance Trade across political and cultural boundaries.
Activity 2  The Trans-Atlantic slave trade
Origin and development
The Trans-Atlantic slave trade involved the transportation of enslaved 
African people from Africa to the Americas and their sale there. The trade 
existed from the 16th to the 19th Centuries. The slave trade used mainly the 
triangular route as slaves were taken from Africa to the Americas and worked 
on large plantations. Their labour yielded raw materials, which were taken to 
Europe to be processed into finished products. Europe, especially Britain, had 
undergone the industrial revolution and had industries. The finished products 
were brought back to Africa to be sold as cheap imports. The trade therefore 
involved three continents of Africa, America and Europe forming a triangle 
hence the term a “triangular trade.” The Portuguese were the first European 
country to engage in this trade followed by other European countries including 
the British, the French, the Spanish and the Dutch empires.
Fig. 6.3 Triangle formed between Africa, America and Europe in the Trans-Atlantic 
trade
The Trans-Atlantic slave trade was as a result of labour shortage created by 
the desire of European colonialists to exploit New World Land (America) and 
its resources for capital profits. The native inhabitants of America mainly 
the Red Indians were utilised at first as slave labour but a large number died 
from overwork and diseases. Europeans looked for alternative source of 110labour. Africans were preferred because they were perceived to be physically 
strong, immune to diseases and available in large numbers. Ship owners 
regarded slaves as cargo to be transported to America as cheaply and quickly 
as possible. Slaves were sold to work on coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar and 
cotton plantations. Slaves also worked in gold and silver mines, rice fields, 
construction industry and cutting timber for ships and as domestic servants. 
During the 17th Century, slavery hardened with slaves and their offsprings 
being legally the property of their owners and children born to slave mothers 
were also slaves. As property, people were considered as merchandise and 
sold at markets with other goods and services.

who talked about my shape and size in like words…I was then put up to sale… 
the people who stood by said that I had fetched a great sum for one so young a 
slave. I then saw my sisters led forth and sold to different owners…When the 
sale was over, my mother hugged and kissed us and mourned over us, begging

Trans-Atlantic slave trade? Why do you think these people were treated 
this way?
The Organisation of  the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade
Although Europeans were the market for slaves, they rarely entered the 
interior of Africa due to fear of diseases and fierce African resistance. Africans 
played a role in the slave trade. African leaders and slave traders organised 
raids to acquire slaves. Prisoners of war were sold as slaves to European 
buyers. Some African slave traders kidnapped lonely travelers, women and 
children and sold them as slaves. Some African leaders sold their subjects to 
slavery. Criminals and other wrong doers in society were sold as slaves.
The slave traders enticed children with sweets and gifts and sold them as 
slaves. 
Source 3
“…I must own, to the shame of my countrymen, that I was first kidnapped 
and betrayed by some of my own complexion… but if there were no buyers 
there would be no sellers. So far as I can remember, some of the Africans in 
my country keep slaves, which they take in war, or for debt; but those which 
they keep are well fed, good care taken of them, and treated well... But I may 
safely say, that all the poverty and misery that any of the inhabitants of Africa 
meet with among themselves, is far inferior to those inhospitable regions of 
misery which they meet with in the West Indies, where their hard hearted 
overseers have neither regard to the laws of God, nor the life of their fellow 
men… Some pretend that the Africans, in general, are a set of poor, ignorant, 
dispersed, unsociable people; and that they think it no crime to sell one 
another, and even their own wives and children; therefore they bring them 
away to a situation where many of them may arrive to a better state than 
ever they could obtain in their own native country. This specious pretence is 
without any shadow of justice or truth and if the argument was even true, it 112could afford no just and warrantable matter for any society of men to hold 
slaves. But the argument is false; there can be no ignorance, dispersion, or 
unsociableness found among them, which can be made better by bringing 
them away to a state of a degree equal to that of a cow or a horse…” 
Taken from Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery 
and Commerce of the Human Species, by Ottobah Cugoano, A native of Africa.

Slave traders did not see slaves as fully human. Justify this statement drawing 
your support from source 3.
After being acquired, the slaves were yoked with wooden yokes and marched 
to the coastal towns to await shipment. On arrival to the coast, slaves were 
sold using barter trade method to the European merchants. The Africans in 
return got pieces of clothes, wine, copper bars, brass pans and firearms among 
other items. Strong African men and women were sold too. There existed large 
warehouses at the coastal ports of Goree, Elmina among others where slaves 
were kept sometimes for months awaiting shipment to the Americas. Once 
the ships arrived, slaves were tightly packed in the ships, usually lying on their 
sides to create space for the ships to carry as many slaves as possible. They 
were tied to the ships with chains to deter them from escaping. The journey 
of the slaves from Africa to America across the Atlantic was referred to as 
the middle passage . It was one of the most traumatising experiences. The 
slaves travelled in extremely miserable conditions with inadequate food and 
water and poor lighting in the ships. There were poor sanitation facilities and 
many slaves who left Africa died of diseases. Besides, many African slaves 
jumped in the ocean preferring to be eaten by sharks. There was a high death 
rate during the “middle passage.”

“... At last, when the ship we were in, had got in all her cargo, they made 
ready with many fearful noises, and we were all put under deck, so that we 
could not see how they managed the vessel. But this dissapointment was 
the least of my sorrow. The stench of the hold while we were on the coast 113was so intolerably loathsome, that it was dangerous to remain there for 
any time . . . but now that the whole ship’s cargo were confined together, it 
became absolutely pestilential. The closeness of the place, and the heat of 
the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each 
had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us.
This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for 
respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness 
among the slaves, of which many died—thus falling victims to the improvident 
avarice, as I may call it, of their purchasers. This wretched situation was again 
aggravated by the galling of the chains . . . and the filth of the necessary tubs, 
into which the children often fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks 
of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of 
horror almost inconceivable. Happily perhaps, for myself, I was soon reduced 
so low here that it was thought necessary to keep me almost always on deck; 
and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters.”

Africa that the practice of slave trade greatly exploited the African continent. The 
African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes across the 
Sahara through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. 
There were at least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries 
(from the 9th to the 19th Centuries), four million people enslaved and exported via 
the Red Sea, another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, 
approximately nine million along the trans Saharan caravan route and more than 
twelve million across the Atlantic Ocean.

Effects of  Trans-Atlantic trade on Africa

a) Trading was profitable at the level of the individual, group, or class doing 
the trading. But what about the social costs of the trade? The slave raids 
against farmers and the abandonment of good crop lands, the stress on 
defence or military activity, the draining of young adults from the labour 
force, all had their long-term economic costs. Klein 1999: 161.
b) Throughout West Africa, evidence of wholesale flight and destruction 
caused by the slave trade can still be seen. People fleeing slave raiders 
left massive stretches of empty land in fertile areas behind them. There 
is still a great ‘empty belt’ of land running through the sub-Saharan zones 
of Ghana, Togo, Dahomey and Nigeria, in other words through the main 
slave-raiding areas. Beckles 2002: 153.
Group work
What do the two sources agree about slavery?
The effects of Trans-Atlantic trade on Africa were:
• Trans-Atlantic slave trade greatly impaired Africa’s potential to develop 
economically and maintain the social and political stability.
• Africans were immensely exploited in terms of human resources, 115labour and commodities. Socially, the Trans-Atlantic slave trade led to 
decrease in population in the West African region. It is estimated that 
this trade was responsible for forceful migration of between 12 to 15 
million people from Africa. The majority of people who were enslaved 
were men. 
• This trade led to increased warfare among African communities due 
to slave raids. There was a lot of civil unrest and insecurity as villages 
raided each other for slaves so that they could capture them and sell 
them to keep up with the European demand. 
• Slave trade led to the growth of some powerful and wealthy states such 
as Asante and Dahomey. This is because their leaders were greatly 
involved in the control of the slave trade. Some African communities 
for example, South Sudan were on the other hand weakened because of 
war and destruction experienced with the slave raids. 
• The Trans-Atlantic slave trade greatly undermined the economy of 
African communities. This is because Africa was losing its most valuable 
resources which are the working class or labour force. Besides, the 
constant wars and conflicts did not create a conducive environment for 
people to engage in any other economic activity.
• The Trans-Atlantic trade created a lot of mistrust and suspicion among 
African communities. The practice of raiding other African communities 
led to hostility among African states. Established code of conduct 
(concerning warfare) that was meant to create peace was destroyed 
leading to high levels of insecurity. 
• These activities created hatred between African states. African states 
were therefore considerably weakened, not only because of the wars 
and conflicts, but also because of the deportation of their much 
strong labour force. It is worth noting that these factors contributed to 
colonisation of the African continent by European imperialists as they 
found African states weak and disunited. 
• The Trans-Atlantic slave trade led to loss of lives and displacement 
of many African communities. Many people fled their homes in fear 
of being captured as slaves. This affected and greatly hampered the 
growth of economic activities such as agriculture and industry.
• The Trans- Atlantic slave trade led to destruction of property following 
numerous raiding, conflicts and displacements. 116• The Trans -Atlantic slave trade interfered with the social fabric of the 
African communities. Most who were taken away were men leaving 
women to head families and undertake economic activities to maintain 
homesteads. African chiefs and leaders who initially were custodians of 
their people changed and became the ones to capture them into slavery.
• Most African states were politically destabilised, economically 
weakened and socially fragmented. The trade left the African continent 
disorganised, underdeveloped and susceptible to colonialism.
• The Trans- Atlantic slave trade led to the importation and subsequent 
enslavement of Africans in America. This led to the settlement of 
Africans in America.
• Long term exploitation of the black slaves produced deep social divides 
between the rich white and poor black communities, consequences 
which still haunt America today.
• The trade also laid the foundation for modern capitalism as using African 
slave labour; immense wealth was generated for business enterprises in 
America and Europe. 
• Slave trade also expanded agricultural production in America.
• The Trans- Atlantic slave trade led to the introduction of elements of 
African culture in America such as African juju, samba dance style and 
jazz music among others.

discuss the effects of slavery in Sudan today and strategies for making sure 
it does not happen. Choose one learner to play a role of an interviewer and 
the other one the role of a politician.
Effects of  the Trans-Atlantic slave trade on Europe
• The trade was of more benefits to the European nations as it greatly 
boosted their economic growth. This is because their industries thrived 
on cheap raw materials from America generated by free African slave 
labour. 
• They also had cheap markets in Africa to sell their finished products. 
• The Trans-Atlantic slave trade led to the rise of rich and wealthy 
European merchants.117It is worth noting that the Trans-Atlantic slave trade had extremely negative effects 
on the African continent. The wealth these continents gained from slavery is evident 
in this continent today. 
Note!!!
Abolition of  the Trans-Atlantic slave trade
Factors leading to the abolition of slave trade
End of Trans-Atlantic trade began in the 19th 
Century with the ban on importation of slaves 
in Britain and America in 1807. There was 
international pressure during the abolition of 
this illegal trade even though it continued for a 
further 60 years. From 1815 to 1865, the British 
royal navy undertook anti-slavery patrols of the 
West African coast seizing hundreds of vessels. 
Britain was forced to pay compensation for 
seized ships and to encourage countries such 
as Spain and Portugal to abolish slavery. The
Trans-Atlantic slave trade was finally abolished in the 1860’s when most 
European countries put a ban on the trade.
Efforts towards the abolition of the Trans- Atlantic slave trade came about 
due to several factors. 
Abolitionists for example, William Wilberforce (1759 to 1833) led the British 
parliamentary campaign to abolish the slave trade and slavery.
1. He termed the trade inhuman and undermining human dignity. 
2. Christians termed the trade unchristian and unethical. Other abolitionists 
included economists such as Adam Smith who argued that free labour 
was more productive than slave labour. 
3. The gaining of independence by the United States of America in 1776 
also led to the abolition of slave trade as it closed slave markets. 
4. Abolition of slave trade was hastened by ideas of the French Revolution 
of 1789. The French Revolution brought ideas of liberty, equality and 
fraternity (brotherhood) that this trade negated.

with your friend how easy you think it was to abolish slavery. You may need

Abolition of  slave trade in Sudan
The Abolition of the slave trade began with British effort in the 19th Century. 
During the mid-19th Century, the British Royal Navy was active in the Indian 
Ocean including the Red Sea where there existed Sudanese ports. Egyptian 
government cooperated with the British and introduced new commercial and 
criminal laws administered in secular courts. This reduced the prestige of 
Islamic judges who presided over Sharia Courts that approved slavery. 
The British imposed upon the Egyptian government that was extending its 
rule to Sudan to close down the slave trade. Ismail Pasha (1863 to 1879) 
signed the Anglo- Egyptian slave trade convention in 1877. In this treaty, 
the Egyptian government committed to stop the sale and purchase of slaves 
in the Sudan by 1880. General Charles Gordon, the British governor in 
Sudan began to enforce the terms of this treaty. He carried out campaigns 
to break up markets and arrest slave traders. His subordinates pursued the 
same action in the provinces. Muslim opposed this move proclaiming that 
English Christians were violating clear teachings of Islam as outlined in the 
Koran. Gordon’s anti-slavery campaigns led to the Mahdist uprising. After 
defeating the Mahdists in the 19th Century, the British proceeded to sharply 
reduce the slave trade though with a lot of Arab Sudanese resistance. Slavery 
was officially abolished in 1924.  The practice however continued long after 
independence in 1956 and it was a major factor in the Sudanese civil wars. 
The Arab enslavement of the Dinka people in the Southern Sudan is one 
of the most brutal and well-documented examples of the late 20th Century 
slavery.119Activity 3  Modern day slavery 
Slavery in the 21st Century
The current wave of slavery in Sudan began in 1983 with the second 
Sudanese civil war between Northern and Southern regions. It involved large 
numbers of “African” Sudanese mainly the Dinka, Nuer and Nuba being 
captured, sold and exploited in other ways by Northern Sudanese ‘ Arabs .’ In 
1989, the National Islamic backed military government took power and the 
Khartoum government declared a ‘jihad’ against non-Muslim opposition in 
South Sudan. The Baggara of North Sudan who neighbour the Dinka in South 
Sudan were also given freedom to kill these groups, loot their wealth, capture 
slaves, expel the rest from the territories and forcefully settle in their lands. 
The Sudan criminal code of 1991 did not list slavery as a crime. According to 
the Imam of Ansar and former prime minister, Sadiq Al Mahdi, ‘jihad requires 
initiating hostilities for religious purposes.  It is true that the regime has not 
enacted a law to realise slavery in Sudan. But the traditional concept of jihad 
does allow slavery as a by- product.’
Human rights watch and others described the contemporary form of slavery 
mainly as the work of the armed government backed militia of the Baggara 
tribes who raid civilian primary of the Dinka ethnic group from the South 
region. These slaves were “forced to work for free in homes and in the fields, 
punished when they refuse and abused physically and sometimes sexually. 
The government of Sudan used slavery as a low cost way of weakening 
its enemy in the second Sudanese civil war, the rebel Sudanese People’s 
Liberation Movement or Army (SPLMA) which was thought to have a base of 
support among the Dinka of Southern Sudan. Abductions during this war are 
estimated to range from 14,000 to 200,000.However; modern slave trading 
did not reach the scale of the 19th Century. It was done ‘discreetly’ and kept 
to a minimal level to conceal evidence. Slave owners in the North would deny 
that Southern children were working for them as slaves unlike in the 19th 
Century when slave trade was organised and carried out openly and legally.           
Many freed slaves bore signs of beatings, burnings and other forms of torture. 
Three quarters of the women and the girls reported rape cases.  120Read the story below:

People tell me I am from Nyamlell in South Sudan, but I don’t remember it.  I 
lived in Joushier, in Darfur.  My baby is named Achuil.
When I was abducted, my father was killed in front of me.  They slit his throat 
with a knife.  Then the attackers took me, my mother and my siblings to the 
North.  I had three older sisters and two brothers.  Both my brothers died.  121One of them was beaten to death on the way to the North.  I don’t know why 
the other one died, but he was very small – still nursing.  Once we arrived, we 
were separated from each other.
I was taken to Mammud’s house.  He mistreated me.  Even though I was 
small, he beat me on my chest and back.  I still can’t lift heavy things because 
of it.  He raped me, even though I was a small girl.  I tried to resist, but he 
sliced my left breast with a knife, and then did it anyway.
I had to collect water and firewood for Mammud’s household.  He had a wife 
named Asha and two children, Mamus and Yaya.  They were not my friends.  
They wouldn’t let me eat with them, and gave me bad food to eat.  I slept in 
an outdoor hut with the goats. I was all alone.  I thought of my brothers and 
sisters often.  When I was sick and no one was there to care for me, I thought 
about them, because they would have taken care of me.  But I had no way to 
reach them.
Mammud changed my name to Fatima, but it’s not my real name.  The Arabs 
told me they were planning to circumcise me.  One of Mammud’s children 
said, “It will make you our sister.” I felt bad, because this is not for the Dinka.  
Dinka girls cannot be circumcised.  So every time they told me they were 
going to circumcise me the next day, I would run away in the morning and 
hide in the bush all day.  It became a problem for them.  They were angry, but 
they were worried I would get lost.  So they gave up. 
They tried to make me pray like a Muslim.  I even fasted for three days during 
Ramadan, but I felt terrible and was suffering.  They didn’t want me to die, so 
they let me drink during the day and gave me some leftovers.
Mammud tried to make me his wife, but I refused.  The father of my baby is a 
Dinka man named Rau.  He was a free worker who I met in the marketplace.  
I decided to be his wife.  We kept it secret.
After I became pregnant, I ran away.  I told my master I was going to the 
market for him, and when I got there, I disappeared.  I went to Matari, to 
Rau’s house, where the baby was born.  When I heard that there was an Arab 
man taking Dinka people back to South Sudan, I took my baby and went to 
meet the Arab man.  I wanted to see my family again.
The slave retriever is a good person, because he brought us back to our land.  
I will try to find my family, and if they are still in the North, I will keep waiting 
for them to come back.  If God is there, they will come.122Thousands of enslaved South Sudanese are still waiting for their freedom.

South Sudan
Similarities
1. All races are taken as slaves.
2. Strong men and women are taken as slaves.
3. There is a price that is paid either in form of materials or money.
Differences  
1. The motive of slavery in the 17th Century was the need of labourers 
in European plantations while in the 21st Century the motive is for 
domestic workforce.
2. In the 17th Century, energetic mature men and women were the ones 
taken as slaves while in the 21st Century, anyone can be taken as a slave 
including children and women.

Missionary Eyes
Lord, give me missionary eyes,
To see the lost and dying,
To see their pain and crying.
Lord, give me missionary eyes.
Lord, give me missionary hands,
to selflessly serve in any way I can.
Knowing that my reward will be
eternity spent next to Thee.
Lord, give me missionary hands.
Lord, give me missionary feet,
to take your precious gospel down the street,
to those who need to hear today, 
to those who need to know the Way.
Lord, give me missionary feet.
Lord, give me missionary zeal
for there’s a dying world that needs
to feel that someone cares about their soul,
Loosen my tongue, Lord, make me bold.
Lord give me missionary zeal.

To see their pain and crying.

1. Study the images above. 
2. What are some of the roles of missionaries from the image sources above.
Activities of  early missionaries in South Sudan
• They preached the gospel of Christ.
• They set up schools.
• They set up hospitals.
• They stopped slave trade.
• They rehabilitated slaves.128The missionaries in South Sudan today still hope to make life better for the 
people they serve. There are areas in South Sudan where slavery is still 
practised. With the civil war in South Sudan, the missionaries and the already 
established churches have taken over some new roles which include resettling 
refugees, preaching hope to the desperate, distributing humanitarian aid to the 
displaced, negotiating for ceasefires  and participating in peace talks . Examples 
of church organisations that have taken over these new roles are the Catholic 
Relief Services and the Solidarity with South Sudan, which is an international 
catholic organisation that works in South Sudan. The Anglican Church and 
Presbyterian Church do the same too. Some church leaders have moved 
with some church members to neighbouring countries due to insecurity. For 
instance, some Comboni Missionary Fathers are in Uganda serving the South 
Sudanese refugees in Uganda. They are missionaries in exile. Father Jesus 
Aranda who was formerly based in Kajo-Keji County in South Sudan under 
the Catholic Diocese at Yei is a good example.

“On behalf of Fr Louis Okot, Provincial Superior, and all the Comboni 
Missionaries, I am honoured to thank you for attending this Eucharistic 
celebration on the Solemnity of Pentecost and pray for our missionary 
institute and all missionaries so that, as we are prompted by the Holy Spirit 
and the love of Christ, the Church might continue the work of Evangelisation: 
the world and our country – South Sudan – are still longing for the light of 
the Gospel.
We are grateful to God for having inspired St Daniel Comboni to take at heart 
the evangelisation of Africa. In the year 1864 he conceived a comprehensive 
plan for THE REGENERATION OF AFRICA by recognising the dignity and 
gifts God has given to the people of this continent. Then, in the year 1867, 
at the age of 36, he founded in Verona (Italy) the INSTITUTE FOR THE 
AFRICAN MISSION. It was his contribution to bring that plan to fulfilment.
At its beginning, the Institute for the African Mission was quite different 
from the Institute of the Comboni Missionaries as we see it now. Since the 
beginning, the Institute had to rediscover itself in front of the great challenges 
of the mission in Africa and had to do it continuously during these 150 years 
of existence.
A former superior general – Fr. Federico Vianello – in a letter to the confreres 
tried to explain these passages as part and parcel of the very nature of the 
institute: he said that the institute was “of lowly birth” and had “a tempestuous 
infancy”. He referred to the fact that, though the Institute was the fruit of a 
great vision for Africa and had the support of PROPAGANDA FIDE and the 129Bishop of Verona, Comboni found himself alone with few collaborators in 
front of a huge and difficult mission. Moreover, Comboni and his successors 
had to suffer much to put good foundation to the African mission… and did 
so because they were prompted by God.
At the very beginning Fr. Daniel Comboni was speaking of the Institute as 
“a free secular association of Clerics (from different dioceses and religious 
orders) and lay-men (coadjutor brothers) that consecrate their works and, if 
necessary, their lives, for the conversion of Africa”. The first rules arrived few 
years after the foundation: a first draft in the year 1871, and the second one 
in the year 1872.
In the preface Comboni specified that: “In order to be of lasting value, the 
Rules of the Institute must be based on general principles” because the focus 
is not on the duties – as in the religious orders – but on the mission itself 
and the demands of the mission. Then, in 1885, the situation of the mission 
– with the Mahdi Revolution in the Sudan – and the Church – Propaganda 
Fide – demanded that the Institute would be transformed into a religious 
congregation with vows – for priests and brothers – to guarantee an institution 
with more stability.
The process lasted up to 1895 under the guidance of the Jesuits. The name of 
the Institute became Institute of the Sons of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Only 
after the separation of the Italian-speaking branch and the German-speaking 
branch in the year 1923, and later the re-unification in the year 1979, the 
Institute took up the name of Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus.
I must also mention that when Fr. Daniel Comboni founded the male Institute 
(1867), he had already in mind the female Institute that was established later 
in the year 1872. They were called the ‘Devout Mothers of Africa’ and now 
they are known as the Comboni Missionary Sisters. During these Century 
and half of missionary life we have shared at the same spiritual source and 
worked hand in hand in the missions.

1. From the speech of Fr. Christian Carlassare, mccj, what do you think was 
the main agenda of the missionary institutions?
2. Assume you are given an opportunity to address a meeting about the 
early missionaries in East Africa. Write a speech that you could give.130Class work
1. With your teacher, discuss what Christian churches have done for your 
community or others you know about. Give examples.
2. How does the work of modern day missionaries differ from that of the 
early missionaries?
Problems faced by early Christian missionaries in South Sudan 
1. The missionaries suffered from tropical diseases like malaria.
2. There was very poor transport in South Sudan. It was hard for the 
missionaries to reach people.
3. Many South Sudanese did not want to change from their traditional 
African beliefs despite being convinced. 
4. Hostile people attacked missionaries in stations. The Church missionary 
society re-opened the station at Lau but it had to be moved further to 
Akot because of security due to attacks from the Nuer. Many lost their 
lives in different parts of South Sudan. Their converts too were killed.
5. In some areas, Islam was already deeply rooted. It was hard to convince 
them to turn to Christianity.
6. Slave raiders and traders hated them for spoiling their trade.
7. It was hard to communicate to the people as they did not know their 
language. They had to learn the local language first which was difficult 
for them.
8. They did not have enough money to buy food, build churches and 
hospitals. They needed to build hospitals since there were very poor 
health services.
9. Communication systems were very poor. This made it hard for them 
to pass information to their mother countries. At times they needed 
urgent help like security, which they could not easily find. By the time 
the information reached their mother countries it was too late resulting 
in the loss of life and some missionaries.131Source 4

Source 5
A writer by the name Marc Nikkle describes one missionary Archibald Shaw 
who worked among the Dinka as “a Whiteman with a heart of a Dinka” 
He never gave up in his mission work. At one time he said “the people are 
primitive and ignorant with deep tribal prejudices against foreigners of 
any kind. Unlimited patience and years of labour, are humanly speaking, 
necessary before these people are won to Christ”. Later the same missionary 
said “Iam getting more fond of the Jieng up here (Gualla) ……” This showed 
persistence paid. However in some areas some missionaries gave up and 
closed stations like at Malek and Lau.

Activity 2  Problems that churches face in South 
Sudan today
1. Attacks from armed groups  
 On 28th December 2016, catholic sisters were attacked at the Solidarity 
Teacher Training College in Yambio who did not want them to operate 
in the area. Many other Christians have died in South Sudan over the 
years. The Episcopal Church of South Sudan recognises martyrs of 
South Sudan in its liturgical calendar (Christian year calendar).
2. Shortage of  staff  
 After the attack at Yambio for example, training staff from Kenya and 
Uganda were evacuated leading to a big shortage of staff at the college. 
3. They live in fear, as there is a lot of  violence in South Sudan  
 There are many militias and almost everyone is armed.  There is a 
complete lack of respect for human.  In 2016, South Sudanese troops 
attacked aid workers in a hotel in Juba and raped several women and 
carried out mock executions. Americans were specifically singled out. 
UN peacekeepers did not respond on time.  Many foreigners were 
evacuated. Many Catholic foreign workers however chose to remain 
and serve the common man but this does not remove the fear in them, 
as they always have to be vigilant.1334. Inter-mission competition
 The early mission churches like the African Inland Church and the 
Anglican Church are facing a big challenge from the many Pentecostal 
churches coming up. They are losing many followers to them.
 Church mission stations today are overflowing with internally displaced 
people who have nowhere to call home. The men and women of God 
are over whelmed in feeding them, treating them and ensuring their 
security.
5. Inaccessibility
 Many areas in South Sudan are still remote thus many churches find it 
hard to reach there and preach the gospel or help the people. 
 There is still large populations of illiterate people thus many converts 
cannot read the bible even in their own mother-tongue.
6. Competition from Islam
 The church faces a lot of hostility from Muslims. In some cases they 
escape death by a whisker. This is because some Muslims refuse to 
recognise conversions out of Islam. They do not recognise marriage 
to non-Muslims. In 2014, there is a story that caught international 
attention whereby a lady who was raised as a Christian due to a 
missing Muslim father was sentenced to death for marrying a non-
Muslim. Maryan Ibrahim Ishaq, was accused of apostasy. She married 
a Christian man from South Sudan. This was a form of adultery to some 
Muslims. International pressure on the Sudan government made her to 
be released. She feared for her life and had to flee from Sudan.
7. Language problem
 Foreign missionaries today still face the problem of language barrier in 
the areas they go to spread the word.
Positive impact of  Christian missionaries in South Sudan
1. Christian missionaries have built schools therefore increasing literacy in 
South Sudan.
2. They have set up hospitals where the sick get treatment.
3. African abandoned their traditional ways of living. They followed what 
Europeans had introduced.
4. They have helped resettle so many internally displaced persons in 
collaboration with national and international bodies.1345. They have negotiated for peace between warring groups of people in 
South Sudan.
6. They have helped some communities get rid of bad traditional practices 
like early marriages, witchcraft and raiding.
7. Some ways of worship promoted moral values in the society. They 
were used to reinforce teachings and beliefs in traditional life that 
shaped people’s behaviour. Some vices in the society today result from 
wrong teachings interpreted from religious teachings brought by the 
missionaries.
