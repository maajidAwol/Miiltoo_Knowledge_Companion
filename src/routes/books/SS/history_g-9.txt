Introduction

Look around you. Name some living things that you can see. Where do they live?
How do they move? How about feeding? Now look at this picture.

Fig 1.1:Biodiversity in the forest
Which animals can you see in Fig 1.1 above? What are the animals doing?
What does this tell you about how organisms interact?
1

When you look around, you see many
organisms. Some are big while others
are small. Some are visible to your
naked eyes while others are invisible. An
example is bacteria. There are millions
of bacteria in the air. Some bacteria are
found in soil while others are inside our
bodies yet we cannot see them. Fish
and crocodile are examples of visible
organisms found in water. The many
plants and animals around you make up
part of the living environment. This unit
entails the study of all living things and
the role they play in the environment.

1.1 Definition of Biology
and its branches
Activity 1.1: Collecting
organisms and examining their
characteristics

In groups
1. Go to the field and collect
these things: small animals like
earthworms, ants, termites
and insects like grasshoppers,
cockroaches, etc. Also, collect
pieces of stone, sticks and grass.
2.

Give the grasshopper some grass.
What happens?
Touch the insect or earthworm
using a stick. What happens? Do
the same to the stone. What
happens? From the results of the
experiments, between the stone
and the small animal, which one
is a living thing? Why?
Relate the results of these
experiments to the study of
Biology.

My environment, my life!
When collecting specimens, avoid
uprooting plants or killing animals
collected. Make sure you release the
animals back to their habitat.
The word ‘biology’ comes from two
Greek words:“Bio” – which means ‘life’
and “Logos” – which means ‘study of’.
Therefore, Biology is the science that
deals with the study of life and living
things. Living things are also known as
organisms.

Branches of biology
Like a tree, biology is divided into many
branches. Can you name some of them?
Activity 1.2: Playing a game of
naming branches of Biology

In pairs
• Write names of the various
branches of Biology in manila
paper then cut them out.
What to do:
1. Hold up one name of branches
of Biology.
2. Let your partner say what the
branch is about.
3. Share your work with other
members of the class.
4.  Repeat this until you finish all the
branches of Biology.

1.2 Importance of 			
studying Biology

The facts

cs

The two main branches of Biology are:
• Zoology - the study of animals.
• Botany - the study of plants.
Other common branches of Biology
include:
a) Genetics- the study of genes and
inheritance.
b) Ecology - the study of the
interaction of organisms with each
other and with their environment.
c) Anatomy - the study of
organisms and their structure.
d) Microbiology - the study of
micro-organisms.
e) Physiology - the study of how
cells function.
f) Biochemistry – the study of the
chemical processes that take place
in the body of a living thing.
Assuming each of the leaves in the tree
below is a branch of biology; draw it in
your notebook and fill the gaps.

In pairs
1. What do you think would happen if:
(a) We did not understand how
our bodies work?
(b) Doctors were not there?
(c) Research on new drugs and
vaccines was not carried out?
(d) We did not understand how
various organisms interact
with one another and with the
surrounding environment?
(e) Scavengers, bacteria and fungi
did not feed on dead animals
and plants.
(f) Yeast was not used in bread
and during fermentation.
(g) We did not have plants to
carry out photosynthesis.
(h) We did not have domesticated
animals and wild animals.
2. List down in your notebook some
jobs or professions that require
knowledge of Biology. Refer to the
chart provided by your teacher.

Biology helps us to understand
our bodies. We are able to know
how our bodies work and how they
are affected by what we eat, the air

we breathe, and our surrounding
environment.This can help prevent,
cure and even eliminate diseases.
The study of Biology helps us
in treating and preventing
diseases.
Here, research is done to invent new
drugs and to even come up with
better vaccines.

enable them to become more
proficient.
Biology helps us to understand our
environment.Through Biology, we
are able to appreciate the wide
range of organisms around us.These
organisms affect us and we affect
them as well. This knowledge helps
us to realise the need to conserve
the environment.
As a subject, Biology guides us
on the best farming practices and
thereby ensuring food security.
Through biotechnology, we are
able to develop high yielding crops
and animals. Disease and drought
resistant plants and animals are also
developed.
Biology is a career subject. Some
careers linked to Biology include
medicine, pharmacy and veterinary
among others. With these careers,
we are able to earn a living and take
care of our families.

My environment, my life!
We should always strive to conserve
the environment in whatever we do.
We should avoid polluting the
environment, destroying plants and
killing animals!

1.3 Characteristics of
living things
What would you look out for if you
wanted to distinguish between things
that are living and things that are not
living?

Activity 1.4

In groups
1. Go to the field for a nature walk.
2. Collect a few things from the
environment. Such things may
include stones, pieces of wood,
insects such as grasshoppers,
butterflies, ants, termites and
branches of plants, leaves or roots.
3. Bring the things you have
collected to class.
4. Observe them in detail using a
hand lens noting the presence of:
a) Breathing structures.
b) Movement structures such as
legs, wings, among others.
c) Feeding structures, such as
mouth parts among others.
5. Discuss with your partner, how the
animals use the above structures
for.
6. How about the things that do not
have these structures? How do
they survive? Are they living?
My environment, my life!
When collecting specimen, avoid
uprooting whole plants or killing the
animals collected. Always use a pair of
forceps when handling stinging insects.

The facts
For an organism to be described as
living, it must be able to carry out some
processes, which are essential for life.
The processes constitute the
5

characteristics of living things. They
include:

5.

Movement - this is the ability of
organisms to change position of
the whole body (like in animals)
or even parts of the body (like in
plants) where leaves or branches
that move.
Reproduction - this is the ability of
organisms to make new individuals
of their kind. It can be through
sexual or asexual means.
Growth - this is the irreversible
increase in size and dry mass of a
living organism. Growth can occur
in three forms: cells of the organism
can become bigger, they can increase
their number or both.

1.

2.

3.

Respiration - this is the process
whereby an organism produces
energy by breaking down food
substances. Oxygen is taken in
alongside the food while carbon
dioxide, water and energy get
released. This process is preceded
by gaseous exchange which is the
process by which living things take in
oxygen and release carbon dioxide.

Fig 1.3 Growth of a chick

Note: Plants grow throughout their
lives while animals stop growing at
some point.
Sensitivity (or Irritability) - this
is the ability of an organism to detect
or sense changes in its surrounding
environment and then respond to
them. These changes are known as
stimuli (singular – stimulus). For
example, plants respond to sunlight
by growing its leaves towards it.
Animals respond to touch, sound
and chemicals among others.

4.

7.

Excretion - this is the process
whereby organisms remove toxic
waste products from the body.
The toxic wastes come from
metabolism (the chemical
reactions occurring inside the body).
Plants use old leaves, fruits and
flowers to get rid of wastes while
animals use the excretory system.
The four main excretory organs are
the skin, kidneys, lungs and liver.
Nutrition (Feeding) - this involves
taking food into the body to provide
energy as well as bring about growth
and repair of worn out tissues. In
green plants, photosynthesis occurs
to produce food while animals eat
plants, other animals or both in
order to survive.

1.4 Various life forms of
organisms

Fig 1.5 Animals feeding

Things that possess these characteristics
are living things. Things that do not
possess these characteristics are nonliving things. Plants and animals are
living things. Objects like stones, desks,
pens and pieces of wood among others
are non-living things.
Work to do
1. Read the above points then come
up with summarised notes on
characteristics of living things.
2. Create a table on the differences
between living and non-living things.

During the nature walk, use
the pooter and the sweep net
to collect various insects such
as butterflies, grasshopper,
cockroaches, pond snails
among others.
Use a small pitfall trap to trap
insects and other arthropods as
these may bite and cause injury
or infection.
Put all the collected animals in
specimen bottles.
Observe other big animals in the
forest such as zebras, ostriches,
giraffes among others.
Back in class, obser ve the
specimens you collected using a
hand lens as shown below.
Draw the animals in your note
book.

The facts
The findings in Activities 1.5 and 1.6
above show that living things exist in
various life forms. Some are very tiny that
they cannot be seen using naked eye.
We have to use lenses like microscopes
in order to see them. In most cases
such animals are made up of a single
cell. They are known as unicellular
organisms. Examples of unicellular
organisms include amoeba, paramecium,
euglena ‘trypanosoma’ bacteria among
others.

Arrangement of goods inside a supermarket.

With your friend, identify the order in
which things are arranged. Why do you
think such arrangement is necessary?
What will happen if the items were not
properly arranged?

2. Now, look at the picture below.
Which organisms can you see?
Name them. What does this show
you about the nature of organisms
in various habitats?

3.

Do you think it will be better if the
organisms are put in some forms
of groups? Why?

In groups
1. You are provided with a mixture
of seeds that include: maize, beans,
groundnuts, peas, rice, wheat and
millet.Try to count each seed in the
mixture.
• What challenges did you face
while counting each seed in the
mixture?

The facts
Different habitats have millions of
organisms hence the need for grouping
organisms for ease of identification and
study. Scientists previously grouped
organisms using artificial means. For
example:
• If the organisms were useful or
harmful to human beings.
• If the organisms were edible or not.
• If the organisms lived on land, water
or air.
However, such features could not form
meaningful groups for study. A scientist
called Carl Von Linne’ (Carolus
Linnaeus), in 1753 introduced a
modern way of classifying organisms.

Mixed seeds

2.

Now, separate the seeds into
individual groups say maize alone,
beans alone, etc as shown below.

Sorted seeds

11

3.

Try counting the maize and the bean
seeds separately.
• Is it now easier to count the
separated seeds? Why is this
the case?

The facts
Therefore there are two types of
classification.
• Natural classification
• Artificial classification
Natural classification is based on the
natural order or common ancestors that
is supposed to exist and that is informed
by science e.g. the cat family. Artificial
classification on the other hand is
based on superficial characteristics,
imaginations or human uses e.g parasites
or pests.
Work to do

Based on the descriptions above, come
up with a table showing the differences
b e t we e n n a t u r a l a n d a r t i f i c i a l
classification methods. Did your table
look like this?

In groups
1. Take a walk outside the classroom
and collect different types of living
organisms.
Caution! Some organisms can sting!
Others can bite! Therefore do not
use your bare hands to handle such
organisms. Use protective gloves.
2. Take the collected organisms back
to class for study.
3. Put the organisms into various
groups.
You can use these features;
• Number of legs
• Presence of wings
• Presence of antennae
• What covers the body, etc
4. Share your findings with the rest of
the class.

Importance of classification

The facts
There are about 1.8 million species of
known organisms. It is also believed that
there could be many more undiscovered
species in the forest ecosystems and in
deep seas.

Study questions

The facts
It is sometimes difficult to identify living
things using local names. This is because
of the existence of several local languages.
To assist scientists from different parts
of the world to communicate, one
scientific name is given.
• This creates no confusion as to
which organism is being referred to.
• Scientific names rarely change.
• Scientific names are written in the
same language around the world.

1. Which of the administrative units
has:
(a) The largest number of
people?
(b) The smallest number of
people?
2. What do you think is the
importance of this manual of
grouping of people?
3. Talk to your friend about this,
then compare with hierachy of
classifications.
13

Table 1.3 : Relating order of taxa to
address information

The facts
When grouping organisms, it is necessary
to have an organised order.This enables
organisms to be identified easily
depending on the level of classification
they are placed. Different levels of
classification in which organisms are
placed form a taxonomic unit. Each
taxonomic unit is referred to as a
taxon (plural taxa). The order in which
the taxa are arranged starting from
the highest to the lowest is taxonomic
hierarchy of classification.
Kingdom
Phylum/division
Class
Order
Family
Genus
Species
Fig 1.11:Taxonomic Hierarchy of classification

This hierarchical order corresponds
to the address information in Table 1.2.
In Activity 1.12 above we can relate
the order of the taxa to the address
information.
Work to do
In the following table, write the correct
classification against the address
information. The first one has been
done for you.

Administrative

Village
Home

The facts
From your work above, The country has
the highest number of people just like the
kingdom which has the largest number of
organisms. On the other hand, the village
has the lowest number of people which
corresponds to the species level in the
classification hierachy.
Therefore, organisms placed in the same
kingdom share fewer basic features
as compared to those at species level.
For example, all multicellular organisms
possessing chlorophyll and synthesise
organic food substance are placed
in Kingdom Plantae, those that are
multicellular but feed on already made
organic food substances are placed in
Kingdom animalia.
Kingdom is the taxon with more
members and it is split further into
phyla (singular-phylum) or division
(when referring to plants). Phylum or
division is further split into classes,
classes into order, order into family,
family into genus and finally genus into
species.
As you progress from Kingdom to the
lower levels of classification; the features
shared by the organisms become more,
while the number of organisms become

fewer. As such, species being the lowest
level of classification comprises of
closely related organisms that share
many characteristics.
A species can therefore be defined
as a group of organisms which can
naturally interbreed to give rise to a
viable offspring.

3. Now observe the external features
of the organisms you had placed
in Kingdom Animalia. The external
features of these animals will
enable you to place them either in
the same group or different groups.
4. Look at the organisms below.

Activity 1.13: How can organisms
be placed into various taxa?

In groups
Your teacher will provide you with the
following:
• Laboratory rat or rabbit
• Housefly, butterfly, grasshopper
• Grass, bean plant, maize plant
among others.
1. Try to group these organisms into
their respective kingdoms.
• Cite the features that you used
to place the above organisms in
the various groups.
2. Observe keenly the roots and leaves

My environment, my life!
Collect only specimen you need. Do
not harm the organisms nor pollute
the environment.

The facts
The most commonly used criteria for
classification of organisms is use of
observable features.

Observable features can be external
or internal. External physical features
of organisms are mainly used to put
organisms into different taxonomic unit.
These features include number of legs,
number of eyes, types of leaves, among
others. Organisms that are closely
related have more common features
and are therefore grouped together.
Those that are distantly related have
less common features and are grouped
separately. Study table 1.4 below.
Summarise the features that were used
to rank the organisms.

In pairs
Read the following story then
discuss the study question.
Do you remember the long lost
cousin you were looking for? You
have finally located the house where
this cousin lives. However, you have
been told that your cousin is at
school. To assist you find your cousin
the teacher tells you that there are
five learners with the same name as
your cousin’s first name.
The teacher assisting you asks you
if your cousin is tall or short. You
say tall.You are told that of the five
learners, who share your cousin’s
first name, three are tall.
The teacher asks you if your cousin
has a light skin complexion or dark
skin complexion.You say dark skin
complexion.You are told that of the
three tall learners, two are darkskinned.
The teacher then asks you if your
cousin has straight or curly hair. You
say that your cousin has curly hair.
The teacher then says that your
cousin is in Secondary 3 East. The
teacher then goes to fetch your
cousin of whom you are pleased to
see again after a long time.
Study Question

What characteristics did you follow
to find your lost cousin? Write
them down.

The facts
Naming of organisms is called
nomenclature. The system of
naming organisms whereby an
organism is given two scientific names
is called Binomial nomenclature.
The two names represent the Genus
and the Species of the organism. This
system of naming is conventional i.e.
it is accepted and is used by scientists
all over the world irrespective of their
language used.
Rules of Binomial Nomenclature
1. The genus name is written first
followed by the species name.
2. The genus name always starts with
a capital letter.The species name
is written in small letters.
3. T h e t wo n a m e s s h o u l d b e

1.8 Dichotomous key
The term dichotomous comes from
the word “dichotomy” which means
divided into two parts. A dichotomous
key is a set of instructions used to
identify unknown organisms. To be able
to identify organisms, observable features
are used.This key uses two variations in
description of a characteristic or feature
for identification. The key is used to
identify and place new or unknown
organisms into specific taxonomic units
or groups. The organisms can then be
named.
Activity 1.16

In pairs
Materials:
• Hand lens
• Fish (in a bottle containing
water)
• Grasshoppers (in a specimen
bottle)
• Snails
• Millipedes
• Rabbits (caged)
• Chicken (caged)
• Pair of forceps
What to do
1. Observe each of the specimens
provided carefully. Note down
the unique structural observable
features in a table like the one
shown below.
(Use a hand lens if you cannot see
the features clearly.)

Table 1.6: Observable features of

3. Use the unique features you have
recorded in your table to create
pairs of contrasting features
that will enable you to split the
organisms into two large groups.
We are all equal!
As human beings, we should
appreciate not only our similarities
but also our differences!

The facts
The observable structural features of
organisms can be used to come up with
a numerical identification key. Such
key can be used to identify unknown
organisms.
A dichotomous key is one of such
keys used in identifying organisms. It
provides a written set of choices, each
having two contrasting statements.
These statements lead to a group of
organisms and eventually to the name
of the organism. Scientists therefore use
this key to identify unknown organisms.
19

the organism.

The key normally begins with general
characteristics and lead to more
specific characteristics. You are therefore
expected to compare the characteristics
you see in the unknown organism
against an appropriate statement of the
dichotomous key in order to identify

If an organism falls into one category
indicated in the dichotomous key,
you go to the next step indicated.
You do this until you arrive at a step
that identifies your specimen at the
correctly indicated taxonomic level.

Activity 1.17: Constructing a dichotomous key using plant specimen

In groups
1. Collect these leaf specimens from your school compound or the
surroundings.

7. Starting with one characteristic of the leaves, group the leaves into two groups
according to the two variations of that characteristic. Assign the number “1”
to the first characteristic. For example, type of leaf: 1 – To the two variations,
assign the letters (a) and (b). For example, simple leaf (a), compound leaf (b).
8. In the two groups of leaves obtained, further sort them out using a different
characteristic. Then re-group them into two new groups each according to
variations in that characteristic.
     For example, sort out the leaves according to the arrangement of leaflets
on the stalk i.e. those with digitate arrangement and those with pinnate
arrangement. Assign the number 2 to the new characteristic. For example,
arrangement of leaflets – 2

21

The facts
Did your dichotomous key in Activity
1.17 above look like this?
1. Compound or simple leaf
1. (a) Compound leaf (leaf divided
into leaflets………….go to  2
(b) Simple leaf (leaf not divided
into leaflets)…..…….go to  3
2. Arrangement of leaflets

Note
• The numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the
key represent the characteristic
indicated in the tree.
• The letters (a) and (b) represent two
variations in each characteristic.
• The phrase “go to” indicates
the characteristic into which the
specified leaves are to be further
grouped. For example, in 1 (a)
compound leaf .........go to 2, indicates
that the compound leaves are
grouped further into two according
to the arrangement of leaflets (2) i.e.
digitate (a) and pinnate (b).

Introduction

Bodies of all living organisms are made up of tiny microscopic units. These units
collectively carry out processes that make the organism a living entity. These
microscopic units are known as cells.

Cells were first described in the year 1665 by a biologist, Robert Hooke. He did
this using the microscope shown above. He came up with the cell theory which
25

describes the properties of a cell. This
unit will enable you to appreciate the
importance of cells in an organism.

We are all equal!
•

We should learn to live in peace
and harmony among ourselves.

2.1 Definition of the cell

•

We should understand and
appreciate each other’s culture
and traditions as well.

Activity 2.1: Discussion corner

As a class
Read the following story then
answer the questions that
follow.
In our society, the family is considered
as the basic unit. It consists of a man,
a woman and children. This forms
the nuclear family. The family forms
the basic social organisation, unit of
any society.
When the family is strong, the
society is strong. From the nuclear
family we get the extended family
that comprises uncles, aunts, cousins,
grandparents among others.
This forms a large pool of relatives.
This large pool of relatives makes
a clan. Clans form tribes and tribes
make a nation of people who share
a common heritage and culture.
Nations make the world that we live
in.

The facts
Just as the family is the basic unit
in the society so are the cells in
our bodies. Plants and animals have
complex structures that are all made
of cells. The cells are modified to
perform various functions.
The cell is the basic unit of life. Some
organisms are made up of only one cell
and are referred to as unicellular or
single-celled organisms. They include
amoeba and paramecium. Others are
made up of many cells and are referred
to as multicellular organisms. They
include human beings, pine tree, locust,
housefly among others. Therefore,
the cell is the structural unit of
an organism. Cells can be likened to
building blocks that are put together
to form a house.

Study Questions

1. What lessons can you learn from
the above article?
2. Draw a tree diagram to illustrate
the societal structure.
3. A broken family leads to a broken
society. Explain.
4. Without the family there is no
society. True or false?

26

Fig. 2.3: Building blocks of a house

Many chemical processes take place
in the cell. These processes keep the
organism alive and functioning.
For this reason, the cell is also referred
to as the functional unit of the
organism. Therefore, the cell is the
structural and functional unit of any
living thing.

Characteristics of a cell
•
•

•

It is microscopic.
It is membrane bound.
It has structures that are sites for
chemical reactions called organelles.
It has the ability to divide (replicate)
since it contains the genetic material.

2.2 Magnifying instruments
Activity 2.2: Examining
specimens with naked eye

In pairs
1. Collect the following from your
local environment:
(i) Various insects
(ii) Plant leaves
(iii) Slices of bread having mould.

A.

4.

Use your naked eyes to examine
the insects.
•
Can you draw diagrams of
their mouth parts?
Examine the slices of bread with
mould.
• Can you see the moulds
clearly?
Examine the leaves carefully.
Leaves have tiny holes called
stomata. Can you see them?

One of the methods of studying living
things is by observing them closely and
accurately. However, there are certain
organisms and structures, which are
too small to be seen by the unaided
eye. In order to see such organisms
and structures clearly, a microscope
or a hand lens is used. Why should this
be the case?
To magnify is to make something look
bigger. Can you imagine instances in
life when you have to make certain
things look bigger? What is often
used?
Look at the pictures below.

B.

C

Can you name them? Where are they often used? Why? What would happen if the
instruments never existed?
Most objects for study in Biology are very small to be seen by the naked eye.
27

Therefore magnifying instruments are
needed.

Features of a hand lens
You have used a hand lens in the previous
unit. In this Unit, we shall investigate
hand lenses in more detail. A hand
lens is also called a magnifying glass.
It is a simple optical instrument used
for magnifying objects in a scientific
study. A hand lens is made of a convex
lens mounted on a frame. The frame is
usually made of wood, metal or plastic.

Activity 2.3: Determining
magnification using a hand lens

3. View the leaf specimen with one
eye.
4. Draw the image of the leaf
specimen that you can see.
5. Calculate the magnification of
your drawing.

The facts
When an image appears bigger than
the object when observed through
the hand lens, the object is said to be
magnified.
To determine magnification, you
measure the length of the object and
the length of your drawing. You then
calculate magnification using the
formula below.
Magnification
(mg)

=

Length of the drawing
Length of the object

For example:

In pairs
Materials
• Hand lens
• Various leaves or insects
1. Hold a hand lens about three
inches from your eyes. Keep
your head up.
2. Using your hand, slowly bring
the leaf specimen to be viewed
towards the lens until the image
is in focus as illustrated below.

× 2.5

5 cm leaf B

2 cm leaf A

Fig. 2.5: Determining leaf magnification

If you had a leaf that is 2 cm in length
and made a drawing of the leaf that is
5 cm in length, the magnification would
be:
Magnification
(mg)

=

Length of the drawing
Length of the object

5 cm = 2.5; hence Mg = ×2.5
2 cm

Note: Always indicate the magnification
below the diagram by writing ×2.5.

28

Note: Some hand lenses have their
magnification written on their frame.
Share with your friend why is it
important to calculate magnification.

Care of the hand lens
For the hand lens to last for long, it has
to be cared for. Hand lens is made of
a glass part which can gather dust or
break if it falls down.
Activity 2.4: Discussion corner

In groups
1. In your study group, discuss
ways of caring for a hand lens.
2. Why is this important?
3. Compare your findings with the
facts below.

The facts
• The hand lens should be stored in
a dry place where the lens cannot
break or get scratched.
• The hand lens should be cleaned by
use of a special soft tissue.
• Handle the hand lens with care to
avoid breaking the lens.

Self Test 2.1
1. A student used a hand lens
to observe an ant. The actual
length of the ant was 0.6 cm.
On observing, the ant was
6.8 cm long. Calculate the
magnification.
2. Identify circumstances where a
hand lens can be used to observe
features of a big organism.

2.3 Parts and functions of
a light microscope
A light microscope uses light rays and
a system of lenses to magnify images
of small objects. Have you ever come
across a microscope? How does it look
like?

A microscope is an instrument that
is used to observe cells which are
too small to be seen by the eye
unaided. There are different types of
microscopes. The most commonly
used one is the light microscope. It is
called light microscope because it uses
light to illuminate the specimen. Other
examples of microscopes include
electron microscope and compound
microscope.
Money matters!
The microscope is a very delicate and
expensive instrument.Therefore, enough
care has to be taken when handling it.

The facts
The field of view is the circular
space in the microscope in which the
image of the specimen is observed. It
varies according to the magnification
at which the specimen is viewed.
Under low magnification power, the
field of view is wider than under high
magnification power.
diameter of the
field of view

Fig. 2.8: Field of view

If 25 plant cells are to be viewed under
a microscope, all may be seen under
low power magnification, but only 10
of these may be seen at high power
magnification. This is because at lower
magnification, the cells are magnified
less hence appear smaller. Under high
power, the magnification is greater and
the cells appear larger. As such, fewer
cells are seen under high power.

Steps to follow when using a light
microscope

1.

Place the microscope on a bench,
always in an upright position, with
its arm towards you. Do not place
it in bright sunlight to avoid too
much light getting to the eye.
2. Use the iris diaphragm to increase
or decrease the amount of light
getting into the microscope from
the light source. If the light is too
much, it will be difficult to see
details of the specimen.
3. Carefully mount the specimen on
the microscope slide and cover it
with a cover slip. Your teacher will
provide the specimen or help you
to prepare one.
4. Place the microscope slide on the
stage so that the specimen is in the
middle of the hole on the stage.
Gently lower the stage clips to hold
the slide in place.
5. Watch the slide from the side, and
use the coarse adjustment knob to
lower the body tube (or raise the
stage). Do this carefully until the
end of the objective lens is about 2
mm above the cover slip. The lens
should not touch the cover slip.
6. Look through the eyepiece lens.
Keep both eyes open when looking
through the eyepiece.
33

7.

Turn the coarse adjustment knob
slowly upwards, to raise the
body tube. This is to increase the
distance between the slide and the
objective lens in order to focus the
specimen. When focusing, do not
move the body tube downwards.
The objective lens could crush the
slide and both may be damaged.
8. To examine the specimen under
high power, rotate the nosepiece
till the high power objective clicks
into position. Be careful that the
objective lens does not touch the
cover slip.
9. You may need to turn the fine
adjustment knob slightly to get a
better focus of the specimen.
10. Never use the coarse adjustment
knob to focus specimens under high
power objective.This is because the
high power objective is too near the
slide. It could damage the slide and
the objective lens.

Care of the microscope
A microscope is a very delicate and
expensive instrument. Utmost care
should be taken when handling it.
Activity 2.6: Discussion corner

In groups
1. Discuss how to care, handle and
store a light microscope.
2. Compare your work with other
groups.
3. Now, read the facts below. Did
you get it right?

The facts
The microscope requires special care
during handling and storage. Some of
34

the ways of handling and caring for a
microscope are discussed below.
1. Keep the lenses clean by carefully
wiping them with special lens tissue.
Do not use water or tissue paper
nor touch the lenses with your
fingers or allow them to get wet.
2. Never focus downwards when
your eyes are looking through the
eye-piece lens. You could break
slides and damage the objective
lens.
3. Hold the microscope with your two
hands. One holding the arm and the
other the base when moving it from
one place to another.
4. To avoid straining your eyes, learn
to keep both eyes open when
looking through the eyepiece.
5. Always cover the specimen with a
coverslip and make sure the slides
and coverslips are clean.
6. Avoid tilting the microscope when
you have a wet preparation on the
slide as it could run off.
7. Always keep the stage of the
microscope clean and dry.

Storing the microscope
It is important to store the microscope
well after use. Follow the procedure
below to prepare the microscope for
storage.

Turn off the light if using an electric
microscope.
Cover the microscope with its
cover. If there is no cover, improvise
one to prevent accumulation of
dust.
Pick up the microscope by its arm
with one hand, support it under
the base with the other hand and
return it to its storage box or
cabinet.

Self Test 2.2

2.

Arrange the following steps of
setting up a microscope with a
slide for viewing into the correct
sequence.
(a) Select the medium objective
lens (×10) or the low power
of the two objective lenses.
Turn the coarse focusing
knob to bring this lens as
close to the slide as possible.
(b) With the part of the
specimen to be examined in
the centre of the field of view,
rotate the nosepiece so that
the high power objective
lens is in line. Look through
the eyepiece and focus with
the fine adjustment knob.
(c) Adjust the mirror to reflect
light towards the stage.
Check the adjustment of
the condenser. Check that
the iris diaphragm is about
half open. Place the slide on
the stage with the specimen
for examination near the
centre of the hole.
(d) Look through the eyepiece
and turn the focusing knob
to move the objective lens
away from the slide until the
specimen comes into focus.
Give the difference between a
light microscope and a hand lens.

Biological drawings
You will be required to look at a large
number of specimens during this
course. You are much more likely to
remember them if you draw them.
Drawing a specimen requires you to
pay attention to detail so that you can
re-create it on the sheet. While doing
this, your brain is recording these
same features in such a way that you
can recall them if necessary.
Activity 2.7: Observing prepared
slides using a light microscope

In groups
Materials
• Light microscope
• Prepared slides
Procedure
1. Set the microscope on a bench.
2. Follow the steps as already
learnt.
3. Observe the prepared slides.
4. Make a drawing of what you
observe.
Study Questions

(a) Was your drawing the same as
the specimen observed?
(b) How large or small was your
diagram compared to the
specimen?

The facts
Scientific drawings are an important
part of the science of Biology. All
biologists should be able to produce
good quality scientific drawings.
Drawings not only allow you to record
an image of the specimen observed,
35

but more importantly, they help you to
remember the specimen as well as the
important features of the specimen.
The following are some guidelines
that you should follow when drawing

All drawings must be done in
pencil only and should be done on
plain papers.
Drawings must be large and
clear so that features can be easily
distinguished.They should be large
enough to show all parts without
crowding.
Keep your drawings to the left of
the page. Save the right-hand side
of the page for labels.
Never use arrows to label
diagrams. Lines should be drawn
with a ruler and parallel to each
other. The lettering of the words
should be horizontal and in pencil.
Always use distinct, single lines
when drawing. Avoid broken lines.
Do not shade your drawings.
Dark areas in a drawing to be
indicated using dots.		
All drawings must have the following
indicated:
•
Title – give a full, clear and
concise title that explains

36

•
•

•

what is being illustrated.
Magnification – indicate the
magnification at which the
specimen was observed.
Labels – always include labels
of the important features of
the specimen. Each label line
must be straight and should
not overlap with other label
lines; all labels must be to one
side left or right.
Scale – always include a scale
bar indicating the length or
width of the specimen drawn.

appearance but not in physical size.

Activity 2.8: Class activity

As an individual
1. Take a piece of paper from your
book and spread it flat on your
desk.
2. Measure the lengths of the
paper and its width.
• Are the lengths of the
paper equal?
• Find the area of the paper
by multiplying the length
and the width.
3. Now try to fold it.
4. Measure the lengths of the piece
of folded paper.
• Are the lengths of sides of
the folded paper equal?
• Find the area of the folded
paper by multiplying the
length and the width.
• How does it compare
to the area obtained in
procedure 2?
5. Divide the area obtained in
procedure 2 above by the one
obtained in procedure 4.
• How many times does the
area of a folded paper
compare to an unfolded
paper?
• What is the name of the
factor of comparison?

The facts
We have already seen that one of the
important functions of a microscope is
magnification. It is, therefore, important
to know the exact magnification of

an object being viewed under the
microscope. Magnification therefore
refers to the number of times a given
object is enlarged when observed under
the objective powers of a microscope.
Calculating the magnification of an
image as viewed with the microscope

To find out the magnification of an
image under a light microscope, you
must consider the magnification of
both the eyepiece lens and the
objective lens. This is because in a
compound microscope, the specimen
is first magnified by the objective lens
to form an image. Then it is again
magnified by the eyepiece lens to give
the final image.
When looking through the eyepiece
lens and the objective lens, one
multiplies the magnification of the two
lenses together.
(Eyepiece lens magnification) ×
(Objective lens magnification) =
(Total magnification)
For example if the microscope has
eyepiece lens of magnification ×10, and
objective lens magnification of ×10,
then total magnification is calculated
as:
Total magnification = Eye piece lens 		
magnification × Objective lens 		
			
magnification

			

10 × 10

			

= ×100

Most compound microscopes have
several interchangeable objective
lenses. This makes it possible to have
a number of magnifications with the
same microscope.

Estimation of cell size
We have already seen that cells are so
small that they can only be observed
with the use of a microscope. They
are described as microscopic. For this
reason, the units of measurements
for cells are also very small. They are
measured in units called micrometres
(µm). When estimating the size of a
cell, you need to know the diameter of
the field of view at each magnification
of the microscope.
Activity 2.9: Calculating
magnification

In pairs
Materials
• Microscope
• Transparent ruler
• Temporary slide with onion cells
Procedure
1. Place a transparent ruler on
the microscope stage so that it
extends across the diameter of
the cell.
2. Count the number of millimetre
marks that you can see under the
microscope. This is the diameter
of the field of view. Note it down,
for example diameter of field of
view is 3 mm.
3. Place a temporary slide with
onion tissue on the stage and
38

focus under objective lens.
4. Count the total number of cells
that occupy the diameter of the
field of view. For example four
cells.
5. Divide the diameter of the field
of view by the total number of
cells counted 3 = 0.75 mm.
4
6. This will give you the length of
one cell image, in millimetres.
But 1 millimetre = 1000
micrometres (µm)
7. To calculate the size of the
image of the cell as seen under
this low power magnification,
you use the formula:
Length of the cell image ×
1000
0.75 × 1000 = 750 µm
8. In order to calculate the real
length of the cell, divide the size
of the cell image with the total
magnification of the cell. i.e
Length of cell image
× 1000 = µm
Total magnification

Repeat the procedure in order
to estimate the actual size of
the cell at medium or even high
power, each time dividing the
size of the cell image with the
correct total magnification of the
microscope i.e (Eye piece lens
magnification × Objective
lens magnification).

2.4 Structure of plant and
animal cells
We have seen that the cell is the basic
unit from which plants and animals
are made. The cell itself is made up of

smaller structures called organelles.
Each organelle carries out a specific
function just as it is in the family where
the father, mother and children have
specific roles to play.

a) Cell structure as seen
under light microscope
Most cells organelles are transparent
and may be difficult to see and draw.
When such structures are dyed or
stained with substances such as iodine,
they become visible under the light
microscope. Some cell organelles can
be seen under the light microscope
while others are too small to be seen.

Materials:
Light microscope, permanent slides
of animal tissue.
Procedure
1. Follow the steps in Activity
2.5 part B on how to use a
microscope. This time, use
a permanent slide that the
teacher will provide you with.
2. Repeat the procedure, but this
time use the medium power
objective lens, and then the high
power objective lens.

2.5 Functions of parts of
plant cell and animal
cell
What are the functions of the parts of
an animal and plant cell?

Activity 2.13: Research activity

In pairs
1. Find out from textbooks and
various reference materials, the
functions of parts of plant and
animal cells.
2. Discuss the functions of parts of
a plant and animal cell.
3. Compare your findings to that
of your friends.

Note: Animal cells have no cell walls.

(b) Cell membrane
The cell membrane is also called
plasma membrane. Its functions
include:
•
•

The facts
The following are some of the
components of a cell as seen under a
light microscope and their functions.

(a) Cell wall
The cell wall is the non-living, outer
most part of plant cells. It is made
of cellulose. Cellulose is tough and
resists stretching. The cell wall gives
firmness and a fixed shape to a plant
cell due to presence of cellulose. Its
functions include:
•
•
•

To provide mechanical support to
the plant in herbaceous plants.
To protect and give the plant cells
a definite shape.
To allow gases, water and other
substances to move in and out of
the cell. It is freely permeable.

•

To enclose the inner contents of the
cell.
To allow selective movement of
substances into and out of the
cell. It therefore forms a barrier
that separates the cell from its
surroundings.
To communicate with other cells
through signalling.

(c) Cytoplasm
Cytoplasm is a fluid-filled medium in
which chemical reactions take place.
It is a medium in which cell organelles
and other substances such as starch
granules, fat droplets, glycogen
and other dissolved substances are
suspended.

(d) Nucleus
The nucleus is a large spherical body
enclosed by a nuclear membrane.
It has small spaces called pores which
allow exchange of substances.

(c) Controls how cells divide and grow.
Nucleolus: The nucleolus is found
inside the nucleus and it synthesises
ribosomes. Ribosomes are the sites for
protein synthesis.

(f) Chloroplast
Chloroplasts are oval-shaped
chlorophyll containing organelles. They
are found in large numbers in plants
and cells that carry out photosynthesis.

Self Test 2.3
1. Why do you think plant cells are
rigid with a definite shape unlike
animal cells?
2. What is the importance of plant
leaves being green?

(e) Vacuoles
Vacuoles are fluid-filled sacs in the
cell. They vary in size from one cell
to another. Plant cells normally have
large vacuoles while many animal
cells have no vacuoles. If present, they
are temporary, minute and scattered
in the cytoplasm. In plant cells they
contain sap; hence they are called sap
vacuoles. In animal cells the vacuoles
may store food. This especially occurs
in unicellular organisms like amoeba.
Unicellular organisms may also
44

(g) Mitochondrion
The mitochondrion (plural
mitochondria) is found in most
eukaryotic cells. It is the site for
energy production in the cell.
Mitochondria carry out the processes
that produce energy in a cell. They
are therefore considered as the
powerhouse of a cell.
We need energy to do work. For
example, muscles in our bodies enable

us to perform various tasks. They use
a lot of energy. Therefore, the muscle
cells have more mitochondria than
cells in other parts of the body. Cells
that have high rates of metabolism
generally possess large numbers of
mitochondria in order to produce
sufficient energy. Examples are liver
cells.

Comparison between plant
and animal cells
Similarities
1. Both possess a cell membrane
which encloses the inner contents
of the cell.
2. They both have cytoplasm.

Activity 2.14: Discussion corner

In groups
1. Your teacher will allocate models
of one specialised animal cell to
each group.
2. Discuss the structural
modification of the cell that
suits it, to its function.
3. Each group will take about 3
minutes to present to the class
the content of their discussion.

The facts
We have seen that cells generally have
the same basic structure. For instance,
46

C.
they have nucleus, cytoplasm and
organelles whose functions are the
same. Despite these similarities, cells
also show differences in other aspects.
They all do not have the same shape,
size or organisation.
Some cells function individually as
unicellular organisms e.g. bacteria
and Amoeba.

Fig. 2.15: Amoeba

In these organisms, parts of a cell
become specialised to perform
certain functions. Some other cells
join together to form colonies. Some
colonies consist of only one kind of cell
and others of different kinds of cells.
An example of a colony is Volvox, which

lives in water. Cells at the front of the
colony make food while those at the
back carry out reproduction.

Eukaryotic cells
Eukaryotic cells are the cells with
membrane – bound nucleus. These
cells are considered to have a full
complement of organelles. Examples
are animals, plants, protists and fungi
cells.

Fig. 2.16: Volox

Multicellular organisms are made
of many types of cells with different
shapes and sizes.The cells also perform
different functions.
The modification in structure of cells
to enable them perform a specific
function is called cell specialisation.
By specialising, cells become more
efficient at performing particular tasks.
This is called division of labour. For
example, muscle cells are most efficient
in contracting.

Prokaryotic (Prokaryotic
cells)
Prokaryotic (Prokaryotic cells) are the
cells filled with cytoplasm but there is
no membrane – bound nucleus. Examples
are found in Kingdom Monera which
include bacteria and blue-green algae.
They have much simpler type of cells,
which lack cell organelles.

Fig. 2.17: Prokaryotic cell

Fig. 2.18: Eukaryotic cell

Most living things are made up of
different kinds of cells that perform
specific functions. This is referred to as
cell differentiation.
Cell differentiation leads to cell
specialisation. Through specialisation,
cells become more efficient at
performing particular functions.
This is known as division of labour.
Cells get modified to perform
specific functions in order to meet
the physiological demands of an
organism. Cell specialisation can
therefore be defined as the structural
modification of a cell to perform
a specific function better.

Activity 2.15: Observing slides
and micrograph of cells

In groups
Materials
• Slides or photomicrographs of
specialised cells
• Light microscope
Procedure:
1. Carefully examine the
provided photomicrographs
and slides.
2. Identify whether the micrograph
or slide represents a tissue or
an organ.
3. Carefully study the cells seen in
the micrograph and slide.
4. With the help of your teacher,
identify and write down the
different types of cells you can
see.
Caution: Be very careful with
microscopes as they are very
expensive machines.

2.6 Specialised plant cells
Some plant cells are structurally
modified to perform specific functions.
These specialised cells include: root
hair cell, mesophyll cells, xylem and
phloem vessels.
Activity 2.16: Discussion corner

In groups
You are provided with charts,
slides or micrographs containing
various specialised plant cells.
1. In your study group, examine
the various plant cells and
suggest their functions.
48

2. Discuss how the specialised
plant cells are adapted for their
functions.
3. Compare your findings with the
rest of the class.
Specialised cells cannot perform
any other function apart from that
which they are specialised for. Some
cells for example cheek cells are
never specialised, These perform
general functions such as covering
and absorption.

The facts
(a) Root hair cells
These are microscopic outgrowths
which are located on the epidermal
tissue of the roots. These cells are
adapted for absorption of water and
mineral salts from the soil. Root hair
cells are numerous and thin-walled
to increase efficiency of absorption of
water and mineral salts.

(b) Mesophyll cells
Mesophyll cells are specialised for
the process of photosynthesis. They
contain chloroplasts. There are two
types of mesophyll cells.

Palisade cells
Palisade cells are located in the palisade
mesophyll layer. They are closely
packed and close to the epidermis to
trap more sunlight and access more
carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.
These cells are structurally suited for
photosynthesis.
Chloroplast

Sap vacoule

Fig. 2.20: Palisade cells

Palisade cells possess dense
chloroplasts which contain chlorophyll
for maximum photosynthesis. They are
also regularly shaped. This enables
them to be packed in the palisade
layer for efficient photosynthesis.
Spongy Mesophyll cells
The spongy mesophyll cells are
irregularly shaped. They constitute the
spongy mesophyll layer (tissue). These
cells possess chloroplasts and are
therefore photosynthetic.

Nucleus

Fig. 2.21: Spongy mesophyll cells

They are irregularly shaped to create
intercellular spaces for free movement

of gases.
Note: Palisade cells are more suited
for photosynthesis compared to the
spongy mesophyll cells.

(c) Xylem vessels
Xylem vessels are tissues which are
involved in the transportation of water
and inorganic ions (mineral salts) from
the roots to other parts of the plant.
During formation of this tissue, the
living part of the cells degenerate and
are pushed to the periphery. The cross
walls and end walls collapse.They leave
hollow tubes that are interconnected
from end to end for efficient conduction
of water and dissolved mineral salts.

water passes

Cellulose cell
wall
Lignin rings

Fig. 2.22: Cross section of xylem vessels
Adaptation of the xylem vessel

(i) The walls of xylem are thickened
with lignin to prevent them from
collapsing. For this reason, xylem
provides mechanical support to the
plant.
(ii) The lumen of the xylem is narrow
to enhance capillarity, hence water
is transported efficiently.
(iii) Xylem vessels lack cross walls and
end walls. This allows continuous
49

flow of water up the xylem.
(iv) Most xylem vessels contain
bordered pits. This allows lateral
movement of water to other
tissues.

(d) Phloem tissue
P h l o e m t i s s u e s t r a n s p o r t fo o d
substances in the plant. Just like the
xylem vessels, phloem tissues are
made by linking many cells. The end
walls of these cells however, do not
completely collapse. They degenerate
partially leaving spaces behind called
sieve pores, through which dissolved
food substances pass from one cell to
another.
The cells of the phloem tissue are
called sieve tube elements; they
contain organelles like the nucleus
and cytoplasm. The sieve tubes have
companion cells which control the
activities of the sieve tube. A sieve plate
separates one sieve tube from another.

Adaptation

(i) Phloem tissue has sieve pores
whic h allow dissolved food
substances to pass from one sieve
tube to another.
(ii) S i e v e t u b e e l e m e n t s h a v e
companion cells, which have
all organelles to supply energy
and other chemicals needed in
transportation of food.
(iii) Phloem tissues have cytoplasmic
filaments along which substances
stream from one sieve tube to
another.
Note: Phloem tubes and xylem vessels
are closely associated. Together, they
form vascular bundles.

(e) Guard cells
Guard cells are located in the epidermal
layer of the leaf. Two guard cells
border a stoma thereby controlling its
opening and closing.

Fig. 2.24: Guard cells

(i) Guard cells have chloroplasts, they
therefore carry out photosynthesis.
The sugar produced offer the
osmotic pressure in the guard
cells. This results to regulation of
stomata opening and closing.
(ii) Guard cells are bean-shaped
allowing for a space between the
two cells.The stoma enables gases
to diffuse in and out.

(iii) The outer walls of the guard cells
are thinner compared to inner
walls. This allows guard cells to
stretch outwards when they bulge,
resulting into opening of the stoma.

Specialised animal cells
Some animal cells are structurally
modified to perform specific functions.
These specialised cells include; red
blood cells, ciliated cells, nerve cells,
sperm cells and egg cells.
Activity 2.17: Discussion corner

In groups
You are provided with charts,
slides or micrographs containing
various specialised animal cells.
1. Write down some examples
of specialised animal cells on a
manila paper.
2. Cut the manila paper into
several pieces each with the
name of the specialised cell.
3. Let one group lift it up as the
other group give the adaptation
and its function.
4. Compare your findings with the
rest of the class.

Structural adaptations

(i) Red blood cells have a biconcave
shape, to increase their surface
area for absorbing oxygen.
(ii) They lack nucleus, to provide more
space for packaging of haemoglobin.
However red blood cells of birds and
amphibians have nuclei.
(iii) They are thin walled, to reduce
distance of diffusion hence rapid
diffusion of gases across the
membrane.
Physiological adaptations

Red blood cells have an iron containing
p i g m e n t c a l l e d h a e m og l o b i n ,
which has high affinity for oxygen.
It therefore combines readily with
oxygen and transports it in the form
of oxyhaemoglobin.

(b) Nerve cells
Nerve cells are specialised cells for
conduction of nervous impulses in
the body. Impulses are messages
transmitted in electrical form along
the axon. The nerve cells are also
called neurons.
Dendrites

Red blood cells transport oxygen and
carbon (IV) oxide in the body.

(ii) Some have a myelin sheath made
of fatty cells that act as insulation
51

for the electric impulses.
(iii) They have dendrites at the terminal
ends for reception of impulses and
passing of the impulses to adjacent
neurons and other cells.

(c) Sperm Cells
Sperm cells are the male gametes (also
called spermatozoa) which fertilise
the female gamete (ovum) to form a
zygote. These cells are adapted for
swimming towards the female gamete
or egg.

(d) Egg Cell
The egg cell also called ovum (pluralova) is the female gamete that fuses
with the sperm cell. Unlike the sperm
cells, egg cells are not mobile. Egg
cells are produced from the ovary
and delivered to the oviduct where
fertilisation takes place.

Adaptations of the sperm cell

(i) Sperm cells have a tail to enable
them swim up to the oviduct in
the female reproductive tract to
fertilise the egg.
(ii) They have many mitochondria in
the middle piece to provide energy
for swimming.
(iii) Sperm cells have lytic enzymes
in the acrosome. This enzyme is
released to digest the membrane
of the egg and allow the head of
the sperm cell to penetrate.

They are found in the inner layer of
the nose and windpipe. They contain
cilia on their outer surface. Cilia are
very small hair-like structures. Their
function is to keep up a stream of
mucus that traps and carries dust and
germs from inhaled air. This prevents
them from reaching the lungs.

Advantages of cell
specialisation
Cell specialisation is required in
multicellular organisms. This ensures
that specific cells perform functions as
part of a living organism.
Carry out the following activity.
Activity 2.18: Discussion corner

In groups
1. Discuss the advantages of
specialised cell in plants and
animals in relation to their
functions.
2. Write down the advantages
of specialised cell in your note
book.
3. Share your ideas with the rest
of the class.

The facts
Cell specialisation enables the cells
to obtain nutrients and chemicals
and remove waste efficiently. The
advantages of cell specialisation include:
1.

more complex and efficient. This
makes the tissue , organs and organ
systems to be more efficient.
Specialisation leads to categorisation
of tasks by compartmentalising
and dividing the work within the
organism. This means that while
some cells can take care of survival
tasks, other cells can allow for
growth and development of the
organism as a whole.
The more specialised the cells, the
more complex the organism, and the
more the potential for development.
This is seen in eukaryotes versus
prokaryotes. Most people would
agree that humans are the most
complex.

We are all equal!
Our body systems show that we are
all made of similar material and our
systems function the same.Therefore
there is no need for discrimination
based on gender, religion, tribe, sex and
disability.

2.7 Levels of organisation
in multicellular
organisms
Most specialised cells do not work
alone. Instead, several specialised
cells work together to carry out a
particular function. This increases their
efficiency. A tissue is a group of cells
which perform specific functions. Both
animals and plants have structures
made up of tissues.

Cells have the potential to become

Introduction

In order to carry out life processes,
that were mentioned in Unit 1, a cell
needs and takes in various substances.
In carrying out these processes, the cell
produces certain substances as well.
Some of these are needed by the cell,
some are waste products and others
are substances that the cell does not
need but are useful to other cells. Some
useful substances are taken out of the
cell and transported to other cells that
need them. Substances are constantly
moving into and out of cells.

• Adopt the habit of being
systematic, resilient and
accurate.
• Importance of being systematic,
accurate, ethical, and meticulous
in carrying out experiments.
• Share ideas when carrying out
the investigations.

3.1 Structure and
properties of the cell
membrane
Structure of the cell
membrane
Cell membranes are very thin. They
are made up of proteins and lipids. The
lipid material is arranged in two thin
outer layers. The protein part is found
scattered and embedded inside this
double layer of lipid, See Fig. 3.1. Cell
membranes are important because
they separate and enclose the cell
contents from its sorrounding.

pore

Fig. 3.1: Structure of the cell membrane
Properties of the cell membranes
1. It has small pores.

It is freely permeable to water and
gases only. This means it allows
water and other small molecules
such as gases to pass through its
pores rapidly. It is however selectively
permeable to other molecules. This
means it will allow some molecules
to pass through it, but keep out other
molecules. It is sometimes described
as semi-permeable or selectively
permeable as a result of this.
2. It is sensitive to pH and temperature.

This is because the cell membrane
contains protein molecules that are
affected by extreme temperature and
PH.
3. It is also polarized.

It is made up of charged ions. This
property enables the membranes to
control movement of ions into and out
of the cell.
There are three main physiological
processes by which substances move
in and out of cells.These are diffusion,
osmosis and active transport.

64

3.2 Diffusion
You may have already studied diffusion
in physics. Movement of substances by
diffusion is very important in living
things. The following activities may
remind you of prior learning about
diffusion or may help you to think of
an explanation for the process.
Activity 3.1: Demonstrating
diffusion using ink and perfume

In pairs
Materials
Bottle of perfume, ink, beaker,
water and pipette.
Procedure
1. Fill a beaker half-full with water.
2. Add a drop of ink into the water.
What do you notice?
Add another drop of ink. Does
the same thing happen again?
What can you conclude?
3. Open a bottle of strong perfume.
What do you notice after a few
minutes?
Activity 3.2: Demonstrating
diffusion using potassium
manganate (VII) crystals

As a class
Materials
Beakers, water, potassium
manganate (VII) crystals, glass tube.

Procedure
1. Put about 50 cm3 of water in a
beaker.
2. Place the glass tube vertically
in the water.

3. Select a large cr ystal of
potassium manganate (VII)
and drop it carefully through
the glass tube.
4. Carefully remove the glass tube
and observe what happens.
Study questions

1. Describe the observations
made in activity 3.2.
2. Explain the observation made
when the crystal of potassium
manganate (VII) is dropped in
water.
Activity 3.3: Demonstrating
diffusion using a visking tubing

In groups
Materials
Visking tubing, starch solution,
dilute iodine solution, beakers,
string, stop watch or a wall clock.
Procedure
1. Measure and cut a visking
tubing 8 cm in length.
2. Tie up one end tightly with a
string, about 1 cm from the tip.
Open the visking tubing and fill
the visking tubing with starch
solution and then tie up the
other end.
3. Note the colour of the solution.
Immerse this visking tubing into
a beaker filled with dilute iodine
solution.
4. Leave it to stand for 15 minutes.
5. Make observations of the colour
changes and complete the table
below.

Before

After 15 Conclusion
minutes

• Colour of

the starch
solution
inside the
visking
tubing.
• Colour of
the iodine
solution
in the
beaker.
Study questions

1. Why did the colour of the
starch solution change after the
visking tubing was immersed in
a solution of iodine?
2. Why was there no change in the
colour of the iodine solution in
the beaker after 15 minutes?
3. The visking tubing seems to
allow some molecules to pass
through and not others. What
is the name given to membranes
that have this characteristic?

The facts
The colour of the starch solution
changed from white to blueblack
because iodine molecules are small
and moved into the visking tubing
which brought about the change.
The colour of iodine remained brown
because starch molecules are big and
did not move through the visking tube
to the beaker.

65

The visking tubing has small pores
that can only allow small permeable
molecules to pass.
Therefore diffusion is the movement of
particles of a substance from a region
of high concentration of the particles
to a region of low concentration of
the particles. The difference in the
concentration of particles in the two
regions is called a concentration
gradient or diffusion gradient.
Diffusion occurs in liquids and gases.
Diffusion does not take place in solids.
Diffusion of certain particles also takes
place through the cell membrane, cell
walls and cell cytoplasm.
When particles move from a region of
high concentration to a region of low
concentration, they are said to diffuse
along a concentration gradient.
As long as a concentration gradient is
maintained, the movement of particles
continues until they are evenly
distributed in the available space; thus
an equilibrium is reached.
Factors affecting the rate of diffusion

The rate of diffusion of particles is the
time taken for the particles to diffuse
within an available (fixed) space until
they are evenly distributed. Several
factors affect the rate of diffusion.They
include.
• Temperature
• Surface area
• Concentration gradient
• Surface area to volume ratio
• Distance the particles have to travel
(a) Temperature

When the temperature of particles is
66

increased, their kinetic energy content
of particles also increases and the
particles move faster. Therefore, the
higher the temperature, the faster
the particles will diffuse. The lower
the temperature the lower the rate of
diffusion.
(b) Surface area

When the surface area is large, more
of the substance diffuses across it
than when it is small as long as the
concentration and temperature of the
diffusing molecules remain the same.
The importance of a large surface
area for diffusion is seen in absorption
surfaces of plants and animals.
These surfaces are modified to create
a large surface area so that larger
quantities of substances can be
absorbed across them by diffusion.
The surfaces in the small intestine, the
lungs and the gill filaments of fish are
examples of absorption surfaces with
a large surface area.
Note: A larger suface area does not
increase the speed of diffusion of
the particles. It simply enables more
particles to diffuse across it in a given
time.
• More particles diffuse across the
membrane in a given time.
• It takes a shorter time for the same
(fixed) number of particles to diffuse
across it.
• Fewer particles will diffuse across
the surface area in a given time
i.e. 3 - particles.
• It takes a longer time for the same
(fixed) number of particles to diffuse
across it.

(c) Concentration gradient

A greater difference in concentration of
particles between two regions, results
in a steeper concentration gradient
and vice versa. Diffusion is faster when
the concentration gradient is high.
(d) Distance that particles have to travel

The rate of diffusion depends on the
distance that particles have to travel
in order to be evenly distributed within
the available space. An even distribution
of particles is reached faster when the
distance involved in diffusion is small
compared to longer distances.
Apart from the cell membrane, other
epithelial membranes through which
substances diffuse are all very thin,
usually one cell thick.This ensures rapid
diffusion across them. Examples of
diffusion surfaces with thin membranes
are the lining of the intestine and the
alveoli membranes in the lungs.
It takes less time for molecules to
diffuse across a thin membrane.
It takes a longer time for molecules to
diffuse across a thick membrane.

into larger organisms. Such small
organisms can absorb oxygen and
other materials from the environment
much more rapidly than large ones.
In human beings and other larger
organisms, diffusion of substance into
their bodies would be slow. Therefore,
their bodies have developed a complex
system of transport called the blood
circulatory system.

(e) Surface area to volume ratio

The surface area to volume ratio of
the small potato cube was 6:1 and
that of the larger one was 2:1. This
means that the rate of diffusion into
the smaller cube would be three times
as high as that into the bigger cube.
These ratios indicate that small
organisms such as Amoeba have
a greater surface area to volume
ratio compared to its volume than

Therefore, diffusion of substances

The facts
The surface area to volume ratio
of a cell affects the rate of diffusion
into or out of the cell. The higher the
ratio, the greater the rate of diffusion
of substances. The smaller the ratio,
the lower the rate of diffusion. For
example, the rate of diffusion in a cell
with a surface area to volume ratio of
6:1 is two times higher than in a cell
with a ratio of 3:1.

and oxygen from the soil through
the root hairs by diffusion.

amino acids move from the small
intestine into the blood of animals

from the blood to the cells and

Osmosis

Have you ever come across the
term osmosis in relation to plants or
animals? In this sub unit, we are going
to explore osmosis in much detail. We
will also design some experiments
aimed at providing a sequence of
learning activities which will optimize
your understanding of osmosis
through investigating osmosis at the
macroscopic level and then moving to
analyzing osmosis at the molecular
and cellular levels.

2. Does it still feel firm to the touch?
Does it still appear bulging?
Explain your observations.
2. Can you propose how else such
an experiment can be designed?
4. Predict the observation likely to
be made if dilute sucrose solution
was used.

The facts
Osmosis is the movement of water
molecules from a region of high
concentration of water molecules to a
region of low concentration of water
molecules, through a semi-permeable
membrane.
Osmosis can also be defined as the
movement of water molecules from
a dilute solution to a concentrated
solution through a semi-permeable
membrane.
We have seen that diffusion is the
movement of particles from a region
of high concentration to a region of
low concentration.
In our definition of osmosis, water also
moves from a region where it is in high
concentration to a region where it is in
low concentration. Therefore, osmosis
is a special kind of diffusion. However,
the term osmosis is used only when
we are referring to diffusion of water
molecules through a semi-permeable
membrane. In our experiment the
visking tubing acts as a semi permeable
membrane.

		 solvents
Activity 3.6

As a class
1. Form rows and leave a small
space for someone to pass.
2. Allow one student to pass
through the space with his or
her arms closed by sides.
3. Allow another student to pass
through the space with his or
her hands on the hips and their
arms sticking out.
4. In which scenario did the student
pass faster? Why is this so?
Study questions

What do the following represent in
the above activity?
i) Student with his or her arm
close by their sides.
ii) The small space or gap between
students in a row.
iii) Students with the hands on hips
and arms sticking out.

The facts
Students with the arm close by their
sides represents small water molecules
while students with their hands on hips
and arms sticking out represents large
solute molecules. The small space or
gap between the students represents
the pores of a cell membrane. This
activity is useful in that it demonstrates
different types of solutions such as
hypotonic, isotonic and hypertonic
solutions in an experimental set up.

When a solid is dissolved in water,
we get a solution. The solid that is
dissolved in this solution is called the
solute. The liquid that dissolves the
solid is known as the solvent.
Thus:
solute + solvent = solution
The concentration of a solution
depends on the amount of solute
dissolved.

the dilute solution to the concentrated
solution as shown. This is because
the dilute solution has more water
molecules than the concentrated one.
Water molecules pass easily through
the channels or pores of the cell
membrane mainly because they are
very small. Solute molecules are too
large to pass through the pores.

molecules compared to solute

Isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic
solutions

When two solutions of equal
concentration are separated by a
semi-permeable membrane, they are
described as isotonic. Iso means
equal. Therefore, in isotonic solutions,
water movement out of a cell balances
the water movement into it.
Cells in the body are usually
surrounded by a fluid. The cytoplasm
in the cell is usually isotonic to the fluid
outside the cell. Hence, no net gain or
loss of water by cells.
Sometimes, two solutions that have
different concentrations may be
71

separated by a semi-permeable
membrane.
The dilute solution is said to be
hypotonic to the more concentrated
solution. Hypo means under. If a
solution has a lower concentration
of solutes than the cytoplasm of a
cell, that solution is hypotonic to
the cytoplasm. In such a situation,
the water molecules move into the
cytoplasm. The cell expands as water
moves in.
More concentrated solution is said
to be hypertonic to the cytoplasm.
Hyper means above. A hypertonic
solution has a higher concentration
of solutes than the cytoplasm of the
cell. In this situation, water molecules
move, but from the cytoplasm which
is now the area of higher water
concentration, to the area outside the
cell. The cell shrinks as its cytoplasm
loses water.
Osmotic pressure
Refers to a force denerated by a
solution containing solute causing it
to draw water molecules by osmosis
from another solution separated from
it by a semi-permeable membrane.

A solution or cell with high solute
concentration has a higher osmotic
pressure than one with a low solute
concentration. Such a solution will draw
water to itself when separated from a
solution with low osmotic pressure by
a semi-permeable membrane.
Osmotic potential

Refers to the hidden force of a solution
containing solute that only becomes
real when the solution is separated
72

from distilled water or a more
dilute solution by a semi-permeable
membrane. For example, we cannot
say that a 1% sucrose solution in a
beaker has an osmotic pressure. This
is because it is not in a situation where
osmosis is occurring and it is not
exerting a pressure. Instead, we say
that the 1% sucrose solution in the
beaker has an osmotic potential.The
word “potential” means that it is able
to cause osmosis and osmotic pressure
when it is separated from distilled
water or a more dilute solution
by a semi-permeable membrane.
Osmotic potential can be described
as the ability of a solution to take up
water molecules by osmosis. Because
pure water has nothing dissolved in it,
its osmotic potential is zero.

osmosis in living tissue

3.5 Water relations in 		
		 plants and animal cells
You have learnt that living cells
are surrounded by a fluid medium
which may be isotonic, hypertonic or
hypotonic to the cell contents.
We shall now examine what happens
when there is a net movement of water
molecules into and out of the plant and
animal cells.
Water relations in animal cells

The inner cut surface of a strip of
petiole is described as the inner
side. Its cells are exposed. The outer
surface of the petiole is covered by a
thick cuticle. When a strip of petiole
is immersed in water the cells in the
inner side (exposed cells) take up
water by osmosis much faster than
the cells on the outer (covered by
cuticle) surface. These cells expand
more causing a curvature towards the
outside (outwardly).
When the strip is immersed in the salt
solution the cells on the inner side lose
water much faster than the outside.
The cells in the inner side shrink more
and hence the strip of petiole curves
inwardly.
The strips in the empty petri-dish do
not change. Usually this is used for
comparison purpose and is referred to
as the control experiment.

(i) Animal cells in hypotonic solutions

Animal cells do not have the rigid
cell wall. An animal cell placed in a
hypotonic solution draws in water by
osmosis and swells. The cell membrane
is flexible and expands with increase
in pressure. The cells become rigid or
turgid. If water continues to enter the
cell long enough, the cell will continue
to swell and eventually bursts.
The cell bursts because the cell
membrane is not strong enough to
withstand the accumulated pressure
inside the cell.

74

The bursting of cells is referred to as cell
lysis. When red blood cells are placed
in hypotonic solutions, they burst, the
process is called haemolysis. This is
because the red pigment, haemoglobin
is released.
Unicellular organisms such as
Paramecium and Amoeba do not
undergo lysis even though they live in
ponds and other hypotonic fresh water
environments. This is because these
organisms have specialised structures
called contractile vacuoles that act
as small water pumps, collecting extra
water and releasing it out of the cell
so that the cells never reach lysis point.
(ii) Animal cells in hypertonic solutions

When an animal cell is surrounded by
a hypertonic solution, it loses water
molecules to the surrounding by
osmosis.

Normal red blood
cell in isotonic
solution

Crenated red blood
cell in hypertonic
solution

Fig. 3.6: Crenation of red blood cells in
hypertonic solution

This causes the cell to decrease in
volume and shrink. The cell membrane
being weak collapses inwards and
becomes wrinkled. Such shrunken
cells are called crenated cells. If the
solution in which the cells are immersed
is extremely hypertonic, the cell
structures may be destroyed. Enzymes
in such cells become completely
destroyed and the cell dies. If the cells
are transferred to a slightly hypotonic

solution (dilute) before irreversible
damage has occurred, they will swell
again and recover their normal shape.
Water relations in plant cells
Activity 3.10: How does osmosis
take place in a living plant cell?

In groups
Materials
Distilled water, 100ml of 10%
sodium chloride (common salt),
Spirogyra, Elodea or onion cells,
microscope slides and cover
slips, pipette or dropper, light
microscope.
Procedure
1. Obtain a small section of
Spirogyra.
2. Mount this section of Spirogyra
on glass slide and put a drop of
distilled water.
3. Cover with a cover slip.
4. M o u n t t h e s l i d e o n t h e

Spirogyra under high power.
Identify one cell and draw its
shape, labelling the cell wall, cell
membrane and cytoplasm.
5. Add a drop or two of 10%
sodium chloride solution to the
edge of the cover slip.
6. Touch a piece of blotting paper
to the opposite side of the cover
slip. This will pull the solution
through to replace the distilled
water in which Spirogyra is
mounted. As you do that, study
the Spirogyra cell under the
microscope.

cell membrane and cytoplasm as
the distilled water surrounding
the cell is replaced with salt
solution.

(c) Name the process the cell
has undergone.

water to the edge of the cover
slip.
9. Pull the water through with
blotting paper while observing
the cell under the microscope.
– Is the process you have
observed reversible?

pressure but opposite in direction.
Because the cell wall is made of rigid
cellulose material, it does not stretch
very much and the cell does not burst.
However, turgor pressure causes the
cell to become stiff or firm. Such a cell
is described as being turgid. A plant
in which all the cells are turgid always
appears firm and erect.
Turgidity in plant cells is important
because the stiff cells give support
to the soft tissues such as petals and
sepals. Turgor pressure enables soft,
non-woody plant stems to remain
upright despite the downward force of
gravity.
Water in

(i) Plant cells in hypotonic solutions

The sap vacuole of a plant cell has
one large vacuole that contains cell
sap. The cell sap contains salt and
sugar molecules when surrounded by
hypotonic solution. Water molecules
move from the surrounding fluid
through the cell wall and cell membrane
into the vacuole by osmosis.
As it receives water, the vacuole
swells and pushes the cytoplasm and
nucleus outwards against the cell
wall. This pressure exerted by the cell
contents against the cell wall is called
turgor pressure. As turgor pressure
increases because of intake of more
water by osmosis, the cell wall exerts
a back-pressure on the protoplasm
called wall pressure.
A point will reach when no more water
can enter the plant cell. At this point,
the wall pressure is equal to turgor

If there is inadequate water in the
environment, turgor pressure cannot

(ii) Plant cells in hypertonic solutions

A plant cell that is surrounded by a
hypertonic solution will lose water.
Water is lost from the cytoplasm then
from the vacuole. The turgor pressure
in the cell begins to decrease.If this
continues, the cell membrane and
cytoplasm shrink away from the cell
wall. The vacuole in turn reduces in
size.

Fig. 3.8: A plasmolysed plant cell

The shrinkage of the cell membrane
and cytoplasm away from the cell
wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is
said to be plasmolysed. The point at
which plasmolysis just begins is called
incipient plasmolysis. At this point,
the cell protoplasm i.e. cell membrane
and cytoplasm no longer exert any
pressure against the cell wall. The
turgor pressure is zero, and the cell
therefore loses its turgidity. It is now a
flaccid cell.
When a flaccid cell is placed in distilled
water, it will become turgid again. The
cell is said to undergo deplasmolysis.
Plants deprived of water for several
days have plasmolysed leaf cells. The

overall effect is a drooping plant which
is said to be wilting. If this persists
for long, the plant dies. However, if the
plant is well watered, all turgidity is
restored.
Wilting in plants has some advantages.
In bright sunlight, drooping leaves
ensure that less leaf surface area is
exposed to the sun. This reduces and
controls the rate of transpiration
allowing the plant to conserve water.
Factors that affect osmosis
(a) Type of solute

Some solutes when dissolved in water,
will create an osmotic pressure, while
others will not (see Fig. 3.9).

Fig. 3.9: Osmosis depends on the
type of solute

Solutes that create osmotic pressure
e.g. glucose are described as being
osmotically active. Those that
do not create osmotic pressure e.g.
glycogen and starch are described as
being osmotically inactive.
Starch is osmotically inactive.
Therefore, the visking tubing in A will
not change in size because there is no
net water movement into it from the
beaker. Glucose is osmotically active.
Water is drawn into the visking tubing
in beaker B making it swell up.
77

b) Difference in osmotic pressure 		
between two solutions

The greater the difference in solute
concentration between two solutions
separated by a selectively permeable
membrane, the greater the osmosis.
For instance, movement of water
molecules from distilled water through
visking tubing will be greater for a 20%
glucose solution than for a 5% glucose
solution.

distilled
water

Greater swelling
Visking tubing with
20% glucose solution

Less swelling
Visking tubing with
5% glucose solution

Fig. 3.10: Osmosis depends on difference in
concentration between two solutions

The visking tubing containing the
more concentrated glucose solution
has a greater difference in solute
concentration with distilled water.
Therefore, osmosis occurs more
quickly and the visking tubing swells up
faster.
(c) Temperature

Water molecules move faster at
higher temperatures than at lower
temperatures. As such osmosis which
entails movement of water molecules
will be higher at higher temperatures
than at lower temperatures.

78

(d) Surface area

A large surface area of membrane
allows more water molecules to
diffuse per unit time. Conversly less
water molecules diffuse per unit time
through small surface area.
Role of osmosis in plants and animal
cells
1. Uptake of water by roots

Plants absorb water from the soil
by osmosis. The cell sap in root hair
cells usually has a higher solute
concentration than water in the soil.
Therefore, root hair cells are able to
take up water from the soil by osmosis.
2. Movement of water from cell to cell
in tissues

When a cell takes up water by osmosis,
its solute concentration becomes lower
(it becomes more dilute) compared
to the cell adjacent to it. As a result,
water moves from it to the adjacent
cell whose solute concentration is
higher (more concentrated). In this
way, water moves from the root hair
cells to the inner cells in the root.
•

Water enters cell 1 by osmosis, its
contents become dilute compared
to cell 2.

Fig. 3.11: Movement of water from cell to cell
in tissues

•

Water then moves from cell 1
by osmosis to cell 2. The process
continues to cell 3 etc.

3. Opening and closing of stomata

When guard cells gain water by
osmosis from the surrounding cells,
they become turgid, bulge outwards
and the stomata open. As a reuslt:
•

•

Carbon dioxide and oxygen enter
or leave the leaves through the
open stomata.
Water vapour also leaves through
open stomata.

Fig. 3.12: Opening of stomata

When guard cells lose water by
osmosis to surrounding cells, they
become flaccid and the stomata close.
When stomata are closed, the plant
loses less water. This is important in
times of water shortage in the plant.

Why is energy needed to
actively transpor t some
substances into a cell?

Active transport

You have come across the term active
transport in relation to how plants
absorb water and mineral salts from
the soil. In this sub unit, we are going
to explore in detail some of the factors
that affect active transport and its role
in living organisms.
Activity 3.11: Demonstrating
active transport

Materials
Small board, stack of books, toy

active transport using the

uphill on its own. Does it
move?

4. Push the toy car using your
hand uphill. What do you

The types of movement of molecules
and ions that we have considered
so far are those where molecules
move down or along a concentration
gradient. These movements are called
passive transport. Molecules and
ions can also move from an area of
low concentration to that of higher
concentration. They are said to move
against a concentration gradient.
Such a process requires the use of
energy and is called active transport.
In active transport, the cell must use
its own energy to move the molecules
against a concentration gradient.
Such energy is supplied by the cell’s
mitochondria. Therefore active
transport takes place only in living
cells.
Active transport involves carrier
protein molecules. They pick up
molecules of a substance from one side
of the cell membrane and transport
them across.

Factors that affect active transport

Any factor that affects energy
production also affects active transport.
a) Concentration of oxygen

At higher oxygen concentration the
rate of aerobic respiration is higher
the cells produce more energy. This
leads to rapid active transport by the
protein carriers.
b) Concentration of glucose

Glucose is a substrate for respiration.
The amount of energy produced
by a cell depends on the amount of
glucose available. When there is more
glucose available, the cells produce
more energy. This leads to rapid active
transport.
c) Temperature

High temperatures can destroy
(denature) respiratory enzymes
and the protein carriers in the cell
membrane and this stops active

transport. Active transport works best
under normal temperature which in
human beings is 37ºC.
d) Enzyme inhibitors

An enzyme is a substance which
speeds up reactions taking place in the
cell. Enzyme inhibitors are chemical
substances which ‘poison’ or make an
enzyme inactive. If enzymes involved
in the release of energy during
respiration are affected, there will be
lack of energy, and this will prevent
active transport from taking place.
e) pH

Abnormal changes in pH in the
environment of the cell can alter the
structure of the protein carriers.
This will reduce their ability to
transport molecules across the cell
membrane.
Role of active transport in living
organisms

1. Through active transport, root hair
cells in plants absorb mineral salts
and ions from the surrounding soil
even when the concentration of
these mineral salts is already higher
in the cells than in the soil.
2. The cells lining the human small
intestine continue to absorb food
molecules by active transport even
when the concentration of these
molecules is higher in the cells than
in the intestinal lumen.
3. Nerve cells need sodium ions
and potassium ions to function.
The concentration of sodium ions
outside a nerve cell is higher than
the concentration on the inside.
81

The concentration of potassium
ions on the outside is lower than on
the inside. The nerve cells maintain
these concentrations in this way by
active transport.
4. During the initial stages of
urine formation in the kidney, it
contains useful substances like
glucose in addition to the waste
substances. The useful substances
are reabsorbed into the blood by
active transport.

Common accidents in the laboratory
The common accidents in the classroom or laboratory fall into three categories:
cuts from broken glassware, burns from hot glass and burns from chemicals.
Type of hazard

Safety measure

Glassware

Broken glass should be disposed of properly. Laboratory
glassware such as beakers should not be used for drinking
water.
Fire
Flammable and volatile liquids such as ether should be poured
from one container to another far away from a naked flame.
Gas taps of bunsen burners must be turned off when not in
use.
Clothing must not be loose and unbuttoned because such
clothing can easily catch fire.
Chemicals
All chemicals should be considered to be harmful if swallowed,
inhaled or if they come in contact with the skin. Some, such
as mercury, carbon tetrachloride, cyanide and arsenic are
poisonous. They should be kept away from the students in
a locked cupboard and proper handling procedures by the
laboratory assistant and the teacher followed.
Acid burns
• Wash immediately with large quantities of water to remove
the acid.
• Cover the burn with a saturated solution of sodium
bicarbonate, soda water or lime water to neutralise any
remaining acid.
Alkaline burns
• Wash immediately with water and then neutralise the
remaining alkali with a saturated solution of boric acid or
dilute vinegar.
• If boric acid and vinegar are not available, wash burn with
plenty of water.
Chemicals in the Wash eye with clean cold water for about 20 minutes. The
eye
victim should try to blink to help the washing effect.
Shock
Have the patient lie down to relax. Cover patient with a light
blanket or cloth. Do not give food or drink if there are signs
of internal bleeding.

91

Minor cuts and
scratches

If there are any foreign objects in the cut, e.g. piece of glass,
remove it first. Then wash the cut with sterilised water of
antiseptic lotion, and cover the cut with sterilised bandage.
Minor cuts and If there are any foreign objects in the cut, e.g. piece of glass,

Severe bleeding • Stop bleeding at once with a bandage tied near the wound
and tighten the bandage by twisting a rod or pencil
inserted.
• Loosen the tourniquet every 15 minutes and take the
patient to hospital.
Nose bleeding
• Have the student sit infront of an open window with the
head tilted forward and down to prevent blood from being
swallowed.
• Pinch the nose gently for a short while.
• Loosen clothes around the neck and chest.
• Place wet cloth or ice on the back of the neck.
• Take patient to hospital if bleeding does not stop.
Objects in the • Remove objects with water or eye drops.
