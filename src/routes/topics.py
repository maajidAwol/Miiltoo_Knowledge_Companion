      "explanation": "The correct answer is A) Temperature variations. Stalactites and stalagmites are formations found in caves, and they are primarily formed due to temperature variations in the cave. Water seeping into the cave contains dissolved minerals. When the temperature in the cave fluctuates, it can cause these minerals to precipitate and gradually build up stalactites from the cave ceiling and stalagmites from the cave floor. Other factors like wind erosion, plant roots, and volcanic activity are not typically associated with the formation of these cave features."

Argon (Ar) is a noble gas located in Group VIIIA, and it has the highest ionization energy within its period. Noble gases have full valence electron shells and are very stable, making it difficult to remove an electron from them."

      "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Sulfur (S). Ionization energy tends to decrease as you move down a group in the periodic table. Sulfur (S) is located below oxygen (O) in Group VIA. Since sulfur is lower in the same group as oxygen, it has a higher energy level and larger atomic size. Therefore, it requires less energy to remove an electron from sulfur compared to oxygen, making sulfur's ionization energy lower."

      "explanation": "The correct answer is B, 87.64%. To calculate the percentage yield, you need to compare the actual yield (60.3 grams of CO2) to the theoretical yield. First, determine the theoretical yield by converting the given mass of CH4 to moles and then using the mole ratio from the balanced equation to find the theoretical yield of CO2. Once you have the theoretical yield, use the formula for percentage yield: (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100."
