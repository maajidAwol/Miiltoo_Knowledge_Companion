 Introduction to the Teacher ’s guide  
The introduction of the teacher’s guide pro vides relevant information on learning in general and  
learning Biology at  the secondary level in particular. It includes the following sections:  
• Basic learning  principles  
• A shift in learning  approaches  
• Learning approaches in  Biology  
• Objectives of secondary  level Biology  
• Active learning methods in  Biology  
• Model lesson  plan 
I. BASIC LEARNING  PRINCIPLES  
1. Learning is an active engagement of  learners  
The learner uses sensory input and constructs meaning out of it. Students learn  to learn  as they 
learn.  Learning  consists of  both constructing  meaning  and constructing systems of  meaning.  
 
2. The crucial action of constructing meaning is  mental; it happens in the mind  
Physical actions and hands -on experience may be necessary for learning, but it is not sufficient;  
we need to provide  activities  that engage  the mind  as well as the hands.  
3. Learning involves language; the language we use influences  learning  
    On the empirical level  researchers have noted that people talk to themselves as they learn.  
 
4.  Each learner is a u nique individual in terms of needs, interests and  Abilities  
A teacher should recognize and handle the individual differences during the les - son. An 
Individual difference is a good opportun ity to learn; it should not be taken as a weakness of the 
learner.  
5.  Learning is a social  activity  
Learning is intimately associated with our connection with other human beings, our teachers, our peers, 
our family as well as casual acquaintances.  
6. Learning is  contextual:  
We do not learn isolated facts and theories in some abstract form. We cannot separate what we 
have in mind from the rest of our lives; we learn in relationship to what else we know, what we 
believe, our prejudices, and our fears. We cannot divorce our learning from our lives.  
7. One needs the knowledge  to learn  
It is not possible to assimilate new knowledge without having some structure developed from 
previous knowledge to build on. Therefore, any effort to teach must  be connected  to the state 
of the learner,  must  provide  a path into the subject for the  learner based on that learner’s 
previous  knowledge.   
II 
 8. It takes time to learn  
Learning is not instantaneous. For significant learning, we need to revisit ideas, ponder them 
try them out, play with them and use them. This cannot happen in the 5 -10 minutes usually 
spent in a gallery. If you reflect on anything you have learned, you soon realize that it is the 
product of repeated exposure and thought.  
9. Motivation  is a key component in learning  
Not only motivation helps to learn, is it essential for learnin g. It helps the learner to be very 
much involved in learning and inspired more to learn.  
II. SHIFT IN LEARNING  APPROACHES  
• A twofold major shift of emphasis in learning approaches  includes  
» A major shift of emphasis in terms of the learning process.  
» A major shift of emphasis in terms of learning outcome.  
• A shift in the learning process is  from  
» depositing  knowledge  in students  to making  students  construct  their knowledge.  
» learning by listening to multi -sensory learning.  
» teacher -centred  approaches to stud ent-centred  approaches  
» transmission -or expository -oriented approaches to discovery or inquiry oriented 
approaches.  
• A shift in learning outcome is, in turn,  two-fold  
» A shift from over emphasizing the cognitive type of development to giving equal 
emphasi s for all the three types of development, i.e., cognitive, psychomotor and 
affective domains  
» A shift is in the levels of learning outcomes i.e, from lower levels to higher levels of 
learning outcomes in all three domains. For instance, under the cognitiv e domain, 
emphasis should be given to engaging learners in high - er-order thinking tasks such as 
analysis, synthesis, and evaluation  
 
 
 
  
III 
 III. LEARNING APPROACHES IN  BIOLOGY  
1. Approaching in terms of the level of organization /hierarchy of life (Increasing 
complex ity in structure and  function)  
 
 
2. Approaching the subject matter of Biology in terms of unifying themes:  There are nine 
Biological unifying themes, with the  wider application at a differ ent level in the hierarchy of life. 
They  include : 
2.1 Change of livin g Things with  time  
The characteristics of living things are the product of evolutionary processes through time.  
2.2 Genetic  continuity  
Generations are interlinked by genetic material passed from parents to offspring. This is the 
perpetuation and avoids extinct ion of the species.  
2.3 Biological roots of  behaviour  
The behaviour  of the individual  not only arises  through  learning  but also innate  and inherited 
from ancestors stored in hereditary  material.  
2.4 Diversity  of type and unity  of pattern  
Although organisms show di fferences (diversity), the re is the unity of pattern (ba sic similarity) 
in structure and function.  
 
IV 
 2.5 Energy, matter and organization  
Living things are highly ordered and complex matter, which is ensured through a continuous 
supply of matter and energy by met abolism.  
2.6 Growth, development and differentiation  
Living things grow, develop and differentiate by a genetic plan and influenced by the 
environment.  
2.7 Complementarity of structure and  function  
The function of any part of an organism is closely related to its structure and from its  structure, 
the function can be inferred.  
2.8 Regulation and homeostasis  
Living things prefer the optimum and have a regulatory mechanism to adjust in the face of 
changing environment.  
2.9 Complementarity of organism and environment  
The inter action between organism and environment at all level of  organization modifies both 
the organism and the  environment.  
IV. OBJECTIVES OF THE SECONDARY  BIOLOGY  
       The broad competencies of secondary biology in Ethiopia include:  
Knowledge  
• Demonstrate an unders tanding of indigenous knowledge and practices and their relevance in 
today’s  world;  
• Understand the applications of biological knowledge in society and their social, ethical, health, 
economic and environmental implications  and 
• Interpret and apply their biol ogical, technological, and environmental knowledge to make 
decisions about real problems and challenges in the context of their daily  lives.  
Skills 
• Analyze and interpret data, graphics, and other forms of information using scientific 
methodologies to solve  biological  problems;  
• Develop skills such as identification, observation, recording, making  
• predictions,  synthesis,  analysis,  and concluding  the identified  issue or phenomena  of investigation  
and 
• Demonstrate life skills and 21 st century skills efficientl y and effectively to cope up with 
problems in their life and contemporary  world.  
 
  
V 
 Values and attitudes  
• Show  an interest  in the study  of biology,  appreciate  the wonders  and complex - ity of Nature, and 
show respect for all living things and the  environment;  
• Stimulate intellectual curiosity, increases awareness of the fragile ecosystem, and stimulates 
critical  thinking;  
• Recognize their responsibility for conserving, protecting, and maintaining the quality of the 
environment for future generations; and develop  positive  values and attitudes and a healthy 
lifestyle  and 
• Appreciate and respect for the natural world, its diversity, fragility, and finite nature, especially 
when harvesting from the  environment.  
Learning  outcomes  and specific  learning  objectives  for grade 10 Biology  are listed at the beginning 
of each unit, both in the students’ text and teacher’s guide. They will serve as a checklist concerning 
the content, instructional resources, learning methods, and assessment as part of the teaching -
learning  proce ss. 
 
V. SELECTED ACTIVE LEARNING METHODS IN  BIOLOGY  
 
Selected Method  Description  
Discovery – teacher guides 
students to discover scientific 
facts for themselves  Students develop skills such as identification, observation, 
recording, making pre - dictions, syn thesis, analysis and drawing 
conclusions. Students develop qualities such as self -confidence, 
curiosity, interest  
and co -operation.  
Discussion – sharing of ideas be - 
tween students and teacher  Allows sharing of each other’s ideas. Al - lows everyone to 
participate actively. A few people may end up dominating the 
discussion. Not easy to conduct for large classes. Can be time -
consuming. Teacher  
can easily lose track of the argument  
Brainstorming – teacher presents 
students with a word or concept 
and then writes down  as many  
ideas about it or links to it as the  
students can  provide  Useful for gauging how much students know, recognizing how 
many links be- tween topic areas they have made,  picking up 
misconceptions that the students may have.  
Can keep a record  of initial  brainstorm  and return to it after the 
lesson – ask students to identify how many of their initial ideas 
were right and how many wrong.  
Can reinforces new and accurate ideas  
Problem  solving  – students  are 
presented with an exercise where 
they mu st find an answer to a  
problem  Students develop skills such as identification, observation, 
recording, making pre - dictions, synthesis, analysis and drawing 
conclusions. Students develop desirable qualities such as seeking 
knowledge, curiosit y, enquiry and  responsibility.  
Can waste time if not properly planned and  guided   
VI 
 Assignments – specific task 
given to students to find out 
about a particular problem or 
issue Students have the opportunity to research a topic and look for 
information on their  
own.  
Worksheets – handouts to guide 
students in practical work  Allows students to think for themselves  
without outside influence. Allows individual ideas to be shared in a 
group.  
Demonstration – teacher carries 
out practical work if materials/ 
equipment are inade quate or the 
procedure is too complex or 
unsafe for students  Students develop skills such as  
identification, observation, recording, making pre - dictions, 
synthesis, analysis and drawing conclusions. Students develop 
desirable qualities such as self -confi dence, curiosity, interest and 
co-operation.  
Practical activities – students  
carry out practical work 
individually or in groups; 
students gain hands - on 
experience  Gives teacher an opportunity to develop students’ interest in the 
subject. Teacher  has opp ortunity to interact with students. Teacher  
provides the standard/expected results for each activity. Can be 
used with discussion method (during discussion of results). 
Students develop skills such as identification, observation, 
collecting, measurement, m anipulation, data record ing, 
investigation, making predictions, interpretation, evaluation, 
synthesis and drawing conclusions. Students develop desirable 
qualities  such as self  confidence, curiosity, interest and  
cooperation.  
Field work – outdoor learnin g 
activity  Helps students develop skills such as identification, observation, 
collecting, measurement, data manipulation, recording, analysis, 
report writing and verbal reporting. Students appreciate the 
environment. Can waste time if not properly  
planned and guide  
Project – short - or long -term 
investigation  Helps  students  develop  (among  others)  re- port-writing, 
presentation and data -analysis skills. Students develop skills 
in using scientific methods. Can be  time-wasting  if not 
properly planned and guide d. 
 
VI.  ASSESSMENT  IN BIOLOGY  
 Written test,  
 observation of student’s participation,  
 presentation   
 reflection  
 written assignment,    
 Practical activity/performance  
 Lab report   
 written test  
 practical test     
VII 
 VII. MODEL LESSON  PLAN  
ERR model or framework for prepar ing lesson plan  
 ERR is an abbreviation : E = Evocation, R= Realization of meaning, R = Reflection  
 ERR  elaborates  how students  must  engage  in before,  during  and after or at the end /closure of 
learning  session.  
1. Evocation phase/stage  
 This is a stage wher e students are initiated to recall their previous knowledge through different 
activities before the “new” topic is presented to  them.  
 The purpose of this phase , through active engagement, is to allow learners  to recall their own 
knowledge and establish f oundation or link to the new topic  
2. Realization of meaning  phase/stage  
 During this phase learners receive new information or ideas through listening to a lecture, 
reading a text, watching a film, or doing an  expt.  
 The teacher at this phase is a facilitat or of learning. The students inquire knowledge,  
independently  sustain  active  engagement  , and , as a result  realize meaning  
3. Reflection  phase/stage  
 During  this phase  the teacher  and students  revise  the new topic,  and look back over ideas they 
have encoun tered and the meaning they have  realized.  
 Students should be supported to exchange ideas and express new information and ideas in 
their own  words.  
 A teacher practically manages this phase by group discussions, asking stu - dents to talk or 
write or share id eas about what they are  learning.

abiotic fa ctors in an ecosystem.  
Facilitate and provide assistance for pair  or 
group discussion.  
After finishing their respective task let  the two 
groups pair (regroup) and share  ideas.  
Invite students that have accomplished  tasks 
effectively for whole class discus  sion. Follow the presentation and 
explanation of the teacher  
 
Be a member of any one of the 
group and listen to the teacher’ 
s instruction.  
 
Perform the given tasks 
through pair discussion and 
cooperative learning as 
instructed by the teacher 
within 8 to 1 0 minutes.  
 
Ask for assistance as they 
encounter difficulties.  
 
Two groups share ideas and 
take a note on what they  
discussed.  
Accept teacher’s  invitation to 
share ideas in the whole class 
discussion.  Ask students to give 
examples of biotic and 
abiotic fro m the 
diagram.  
 
Follow the 
participation of 
individual student in a 
group by moving 
around the groups.

perceive the term scie nce and let them 
relate this with what they think about 
biology. Then together with their 
classmates, they come up with the list 
of definitions of biology and relate 
these with their textbook definition.  
2. Students are asked to reason out their 
rationale fo r studying biology. Then let 
them explore through a guided 
exercise to come up with personal and 
social benefits of biology  
3. To determine the importance of 
temperature for seed germination, let 
the students are grouped into 4 -5, 
germinate bean seeds at diff erent 
temperatures (room temperature and 
in the refrigerator). Hypothesize the 
differences in germination. Design 
experiment. Measure the times of 
germination and length of the 
seedlings. Interpret the results. 
Conclude and infer the result for all 
other s eeds.  
4. Let the students list down and tell the 
functions of major tools of a biologist.  
5. Practice the proper handling and 
manipulation of the microscope  
6. Let the students explore the safety

 Definition of  Biology  
This section should take approximately 2 period . 
Teaching notes  
In this section, students will lea rn about the meaning of Biology. You can help them by giving brief 
reminder of the meaning of science from their grade seven lesson. Students will learn about the 
scientific way of studying life. This section gives you chances for relating the subject of Biology 
with Chemistry and Physics through the study of elements, chemical bonds and light energy. Other 
scientific concepts like, conversion of radiant energy into organic molecules by photosynthesis is 
studied with the knowledge of chemistry and physics.  
Living things are different from non living things because they have s ome common properties that 
are shared by all living things.  An object is generally considered to be alive if it displays all of  
important properties simultaneously.  living systems have  characteristics in common.  
They are composed of one or more cells; are complex and  highly ordered; can respond to stimuli; 
can grow, reproduce, and transmit  genetic information to their offspring; need energy to 
accomplish work;  an maintain relatively con stant internal conditions (homeostasis); and are  
capable of evolutionary adaptation to the environment.  
 Living systems show hierarchical organization.  The hierarchical organization of living systems 
progresses from atoms  to the biosphere. At each higher l evel, emergent properties arise that are  
greater than the sum of the parts.  Biology unifies much of natural science.  The study of biological 
systems is interdisciplinary because solutions  require many different approaches to solve a 
problem.  
For example,  Biology also study the nature of energy transactions  by thermo dynamics and the 
conversion of radiant energy into organic molecules by  photosynthesis the reactions known in 
chemistry and physics .  
 Learning objectives  
By the end of this section, the students should be able to:  
 define  Biology.

discuss in groups and write short note of their discussion.  
Students can use the examples of application mentioned in the text book such as:  
 Wine -making, the brewing of beer, the baking of bread and the p roduction of cheese  all depend  
on fermentation  processes  brought  about  by yeasts,  other  fungi and bacteria, or enzymes from 
these  organisms.  
 Antibiotics, such as penicillin, which are produced by mold fungi or  bacteria.  
 The production of industrial chemica ls such as citric acid or lactic acid  needs bacteria or 
fungi to bring about essential chemical  changes.  
 Sewage disposal depends on bacteria in the filter beds to form the basis of  the food chain 
that purifies the  effluent.  
 Radiation can also be medically beneficial which is helping to treat cancer, studied by 
combination of two subjects Physics and Biology.  
 Discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 and subsequent 
achievements in DNA science led to the technologies of DNA manipulation  that are 
transforming applied fields such as medicine, agriculture, and forensics Forensic analysis of 
DNA samples from crime scenes.

Most microscopes have several different powerful lenses attached to them,  allowing the viewer to 
inspect  the content at more than 100 times its actual size. Biology, as a modern science, would not 
exist without the microscope, and good microscopes are essential tools for day-to-day activities 
for most biologists. In addition to their importance, microscopes are extremely expensive; 
therefore, it is very important to handle the device  properly.  
Handling  Microscope  
The text indicates how to handle the microscope. In this section, microscope han - dling such as 
removing it from cabinet, carrying and preparing it for focusing will be elaborated and it should 
be practiced by students.  
Using Microscope  
The section explains how to use the microscope. Here important steps for focusing are mentioned.  
CONTROLLING AND FOCUSING THE LIGHT  
1. Observing from the side of the m icroscope, use the coarse focus knob to open focus on your 
microscope until the stage and objective lenses are as far apart as possible.   
  
GRADE 9 BIOLOGY TEACHER’S GUIDE  10 
 2. Turn on the illuminator and adjust it to maximum brightness.  
3. Place a piece of thin paper   on the stage, placed t o cover the hole in the stage. Secure the paper 
against the stage using the stage clips or mechanical stage. A bright illuminated circle should be 
visible through the paper.  
4. If your sub  stage condenser is focusable, rack the focus up and down and note t he effect on the 
size and sharpness of the illuminated circle on the paper.  
5. Locate the diaphragm control.   Adjust that control to open the diaphragm. If your microscope 
has a disk diaphragm, rotate the disk  
6. Use the dimmer switch to decrease the   br ightness   and then back up to maximum.   
 FOCUSING THE MICROSCOPE  
1. Observing from the side, starting from the low -power(4X) objective is in position.  The other 
Objectives i.e.  10X objective is longer, the 40X objective longer and the 100X objective lon gest of 
all. 
2. Gently turn the coarse -focus knob to close focus until you reach the focus stop.  
3. Looking through the eyepiece, use the coarse -focus knob  until you get the  sharp focus.  
4. Use the focus knob to squeeze  the focus . Note that as one part o f the field of view comes into 
sharp, depth of focus decreases with increasing magnification, a specimen that looks planar at 40X 
may show depth at higher magnifications.  
Magnifi cation  is defi ned as the ratio of the size of the image to the size of the ob ject: 
Magnifi cation = size of image / size of object. With a c ompound microscope, the magnifi cation is 
the product of bot h The eye piece and objective lenses, so if a microscope has a ×10 eyepiece and 
×40 objective, the total magnific ation is × 400. 
Images o f structures seen with a microscope u sually show a  give the magnifi cation, so that the 
actual  size of an object can be  calculated based on the formula,  
Actual size of glomerulus = size of image/ magnifi cation

1. A 2. C    3. A     4. D  
II. W rite short answer for the following  questions.  
5. The difference between light and electron microscope is:   light microscopes uses a beam of 
light to view specimens and in the case of electron microscope it use a beam of electrons (instead 
of a beam of light) and electromagnets (instead of glass lenses) to enlarge the image of an  object.  
6. Write the function of the following common laboratory  tools:  
» Test tubes: used to culture  microorganisms.  
» Wash bottle: To wash and scrub glass  wear.  
» Dropper: used to transfer small volume liquids.  
» Test tube rack: to hold or pu t test tube  
» Spatula: used to pick laboratory chemicals or media from stalk container.  
» Dissecting pan: holds specimen being dissected.  
» Mortar and pestle: used to grind substances  
» Forceps: Used to hold up or pick up small materials  
» Flasks: flasks a re useful for culture, heating substances, and for temporary storage of solutions 
and liquid specimens.  
7. Symbols of laboratory safety  rules.  
 
 
  
GRADE 9 BIOLOGY TEACHER’S GUIDE  13 
 8. Microscope have several objective lenses to facilitate a quick change in the magnification of a 
specimen and   high power objective lens provides a higher degree of magnification , which allows  
to zoom in closer to the object being studied and see more detail and a lower power lens will 
provide a wider field of vision.  
9. The diaphragm on the microscope is used t o change the amount of light that is being allowed 
to enter through the slide. Closing the diaphragm will  decrease the amount of illumination of the 
specimen but increases the amount of contrast.  The light to the field is reduced  as the   diaphragm 
is clos ed. Smaller diameter and therefore lets in less light.  
10. In order to focus on an object, one should move the stage away from the objective lenses 
rather than towards each other in order to prevent crashing the lens into the slide . 
11.  Oil immersion is a  technique used to  increase the resolving power of a microscope and 
improve the image quality.  The oil immersion  increase the resolving power by decreases the light 
refraction (bending of the light), allowing more light to pass through the specimen to the objectives 
lens. Oil immersion eliminate any air gaps and loss of light due to refraction and  maximizes the 
amount of light that goes through the objective lens.

all animals wi th backbone are classified into vertebrate (e.g., fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and 
mammals) and without backbone into invertebrates (e.g., sponges, rotifer, nematodes, segmented 
worms, molluscs, and arthropods). Alternatively, plants could be classif ied as vascular plants versus

Earliest naturalists such as Linnaeus recognized two groups i.e. plants and animals.  
How many such groups should there be? The answer varies based on the systems of classification 
applied. It could be two  (plants and animals); three (plants, animals and fungi); five (plants, animals, 
fungi, protists and monera).  
Most biologists used to favor the adoption of two groups. What are these two groups? The answer 
is plants and animals.

kingdom system of classification ( plants and animals) the fungi do not fit to; in  the thee -kingdom 
system of classificat ion (plants, animals and fungi) the Protista do not fit to; in  the five -kingdom 
system of classification ( plants, animals, fungi, protests and monera); the protista is a complex 
group. Therefore, it was difficult to develop rigid classification scheme.

Answer  to Question 1 : a brief summary to the characteristic features of animals are given below :   
 Animals differ from both plants and fungi in their mode of nutrition. Unlike plants, a nimals 
are not photosynthetic. Animals consume food obtained from other organisms (i.e. they 
are heterotrophs).  But unlike fungi, most animals do not feed by absorption; instead, 
animals ingest their food and then use enzymes to digest it within their bod ies. 
 In contrast to plants and fungi, however, animals lack the structural support of cell walls. 
Instead, animal cells are held together by structural proteins, the most abundant being 
collagen, which is found only in animals.  
 Many animals have two types of specialized cells not seen in other multicellular organisms: 
muscle cells and nerve cells. In most animals, these cells are organized into muscle tissue 
and nervous tissue, respectively, and are responsible for moving the body and conducting 
nerve impul ses.

 What is  cell? 
This section should take approximately 1 period of teaching time.  
Teaching Notes  
In this section, students will learn about cell. This section starts by making the students to recall 
their grade seven lesson about cell. They will learn about cell whic h is the smallest and the basic 
unit of living things. The students will learn about unicellular and multicellular organisms. The 
students will recognize that some unicellular organisms are invisible with the naked eyes, but there 
are some exceptions like chicken egg cell which can be seen with the naked eye. This section deals 
that microscope is important to observe very small objects such as cells which can’t be seen by our 
naked eyes.  
Let the students  tell what  they know  about  cells.  Based  on the knowled ge they have about   the cell

 Learning objectives  
By the end of this section, the students should be able to:  
 realize every living things composed of  cells.  
 differentiate betwee n unicellular and multicellular  organisms.   
  
GRADE 9 BIOLOGY TEACHER’S GUIDE  35 
 It is important to explain to students the function of cell, and how far unicellular organisms are 
invisible. In relation to the unicellular organism, it is important to mention ab out the function of 
microscope, which  is important to observe such types of invisible things. In this section, it is 
important t o indicate that some cells are visible  e.g. chicken egg  cell. Also,  explain  them  how body  
of multicellular  organisms  is a cooper ative society of many cells of specialized  types.  
In this activity, let the students make a group and help them to do the activity; this activity helps 
them to summarize what they have learned in this section.  
Feedback to Activity 3.1 Group work  
For this  activity the  student should arrange their sitting in order to discuss in groups about the 
study of cell and we are studying cell because all activity of organisms taken place in the cell. In 
addition,  help them to identify unicellular and multicellular orga nisms and let them to give some 
examples of Unicellular and multicellular organisms.  
 Cell theory  
This section should take approximately 2 periods . 
Teaching Notes  
This section introduces your students about the four scientists who have a role in  the discov ery 
and study of cells. Students will learn about the role an English scientist, Robert Hooke was the 
first to observe cells and to use the word cell for structures in living organisms. This will learn 
about other early German scientists, Matthias Schleide n and Theodor Schwann were the first to 
explain all plants and animals  are made  of cells, the basic  views  of what  we now call cell theory.  
Then  this section  also continues discussing of a German pathologist, Rudolf Virchow (1856) 
established the idea that cells arise only by division of existing cells. Students will learn  about  the 
cell theory  states  that: The cell theory  which  states  that, living  organisms  are com- posed of one or 
more cells, cells are the smallest unit of life and cells arise only by division of a previously existing Learning objectives  
By the end of this section, the students should be able to:  
 describe cell  theory.  
 identify scientists who have a role in the discovery of the cell  theory.

 cell. The student also recognizes about cells, which are varying considerably in size and shape,  but 
they share certain common  features.  
Cells vary considerably in size and shape but they share certain common features:  
● Every  living cell is surrounded by a membrane, which separates the  cell contents from 
everything else outside.  
● Cells contain genetic material, which  stores all of the instructions  needed for the cell’s 
activities.  
● Many of these activities are chemical react ions, catalysed by enzymes  produced inside the 
cell. 
● Cells have their own energy release system that powers all of the  cell’s activities.  So, cells can 
be thought of as the smallest living structures nothing  smaller can survive.

Cell theory  
Here you will explain to students the importance of research findings by Robert Hook e Matthias 
Schleiden, Theodor Schwann and Rudolf Virchow. You will indicate how these findings help for 
the development of cell theory. In addition to cell theory, students should learn about certain  
  
GRADE 9 BIOLOGY TEACHER’S GUIDE  37 
 common features of different cell. You should help them to recognize that even though cells have 
different shape and size, they have certain common features.  
The smallest organisms are unicellular – they consist of just one cell. Larger organisms are 
multicellular – they are composed of many cells.  
Feedback to Activity 3.2 Group work  
Let the students arrange their sitting in order to discuss in groups about the three important points 
of cell theory.  
The cell theory states that:  
1 Living organisms are composed of one or more  cells.  
2 Cells are the smallest unit of  life 
3 Cells arise only by the division of a pre -existing  cell. 
All living organisms are made up of  one or more cells , which are considered the fundamental units 
of life. Even unicellular organisms are complex! Inside each cell, atoms make up molecules, which 
make up cell organelles and structures.  
pre -existing cells mean  the cell which divided to form 2 new daughter cells . That pre -existing cell 
was one of the 2 cells which got divided from its parent cell.

 Cell struc ture and function.   In this section,  you will explain  about  how different  cells have different  
functions  and different  shapes.  It is important  to explain  that cells also resemble  one another  in 
certain important ways and contain common cell structures such  as nucleus, cytoplasm and cell  
membrane.  
You will elaborate the additional notes, which  show application of the study of cell structure in 
using antibiotics etc.  
You will explain about other organelles and their functions. In addition to the above structu re, 
there are many tiny structures in the cytoplasm called organelles. An or - ganelle is a distinct 
structure within a cell, having a specific function. Some of these organelles  have membrane  while  
others  don’t.  The nucleus  is a particularly  large and dist inctive membrane -bound organelle that 
contains the cell’s genetic material.  They will learn about the organelles that make up the cell and 
all of their different roles in the  cell. Students  will also recognize  that different  cells are adapted  for 
different  roles in the  body. Most cells contain one nucleus, which is usually seen as a rounded 
structure enclosed in a membrane and embedded in the cytoplasm. The function of the nucleus is 
to control the type and quantity of enzymes produced by the cytoplasm.   i t regulates the chemical 
changes which take place in the cell. In addition,  controls cell division. The nucleus is where DNA 
is replicated  and transcribed to form mRNA, which is exported via the nuclear pores to the 
cytoplasm. Inside the nucleus there are   chromosomes.  The   chromosomes  contains a very long 
molecule of DNA. The DNA determines the sequences in which amino acids are linked together 
in the cytoplasm to form protein molecules. Within the nucleus there is a darker area called the 
nucleolus. Th is is where new ribosomes are made, following a code on part of the DNA. The 
nucleus is where DNA is replicated and transcribed to form mRNA, which is exported via the 
nuclear pores to the cytoplasm.

For this activity, make the students to arrange their sitting to dis cuss in groups; in order to save 
the time, students who sit back and forth can be one group. The answer for the first question can 
be cells have different structure to perform their function; so the shape of the cell depends on its  
function.  
For example, t he nerve cell in human body is very long and extends throughout the body to reach 
the different muscle cell.

Feedback to Activity 3.6  
A chromosome is made of chromatin, which is a combination of DNA and proteins. C hromatin 
is thread like structure made up of DNA molecules and associated proteins. Each long chromatin 
fibre constitutes one chromosome.  
DNA is the genetic material that organisms inherit from their parents. It is double stranded helical 
macromolecule con sisting of nucleotide monomers with deoxyri - bose sugar, a phosphate group, 
and the nitrogenous bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).  
Feedback to Activity 3.7  
Let the students make a group of five students and discuss in group abou t it. It is the ribosome, 
which  is attached on rough endoplasmic reticulum which makes rough endoplasmic reticulum 
rough.  
The Golgi apparatus, vesicles and rough endoplasmic reticulum have a  cooperative work in 
material transport of the cell; for example, proteins can be made by rough endoplasmic reticulum. 
This protein made by the rough endoplasmic reticulum may be placed inside a transport vesicle 
which is attac hed on Golgi  bodies. The Golgi  apparatus with the vesicles functions in the 
collection, packagi ng, and distribution of molecules within the cell or even outside the  cell.

 Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell  
Here, you should explain the students the main di fference between prokaryotes  and eukaryotes.  
Here it is important to indicate that prokaryotes are different from eukaryotic cells because  of the 
absence  of membrane -bounded  nucleus  and also they do not have numerous membrane -bounded 
organelles. These Prok aryotic cells are generally much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Most 
prokaryotic organisms are unicellular. Prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. You 
can help the student to read table  3.1. 
Prokaryotes were the fir st organisms to evolve o n Earth . They are mostly small in size and are 
found almost everywhere – in soil, in water, on our skin, in our intestines  etc.  
Prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the cell membrane  which protects the cell, maintains its shape 
and prevents it from bursti ng. In prokaryotes the cell wall contains peptidoglycan. It is often 
referred to as being extracellular.  
The cytoplasm of prokaryotes is not divided into sections by membranes. It’s. Organell es are 
present in the cytoplasm .  Living organisms need to produc e new cells. They can only do this by  
division of pre -existing cells. Cell division in prokaryotic cells is called  binary fission and it is used 
for asexual reproduction . 
Feedback to Activity 3.9.  
Food vacuole is  a membrane -enclosed sac, which has a digest ive function . It is present in 
unicellular protozoans such as amoeba, plasmodium, etc. They work as an intracellular stomach, 
digesting the ingested food.  
What is meant by contractile vacuoles?  
Contractile vacuole,  regulatory organelle, usually spherical, found in freshwater protozoa and 
lower metazoans, such as sponges and hydras, that collects excess fluid from the protoplasm and 
periodically empties it into the surrounding medium. It may also excrete nitrogenous wastes.

This section should take Approximately 5 periods of teaching  time.  
Teaching Notes  
This section introduces your students about the cell membran e which forms the  barrier across all 
substances entering or leaving the cell, and controls what enters and leaves cells. It is important to 
indicate that the cell membrane is selectively (semi) permeable because it chooses what can go in 
and out and permea ble because it can help  materials  to be crossed.  It is very important  to help your 
students  understand  the concept  of partially  permeable  membranes  and the importance  of 
diffusion,  osmosis  Learning objectives  
By the end of this section students should be able to:  
 define the term diffusion and  osmosis.  
 describe the importance of diffusion and  osmosis for the transport of gases and 
solutes.  
 describe the importance of active  transport.

 and active transport in both plant and animal cells. It can be inte resting for students to understand 
the application of diffusion and osmosis in life. Students should work on  the suggested  practical  
work  in this section  as possible  which  help them  to understand the movement of the  materials.  
A cell membrane consists of a  double layer of phospholipid molecules. This structure arises 
because in water a group of phospholipid molecules arranges itself into a bilayer, with the 
hydrophilic heads facing outwards into the water and the hydrophobic tails facing inwards, 
therefore avoiding contact with water. This is the basic structure of a cell membrane.   Protein 
molecules float in the phospholipid bilayer. Many of the phospholipids and proteins have short 
chains of carbohydrates attached to them, on the outer surface of the memb rane. They are known 
as glycolipids and glycoproteins

Feedback to Activity 3.14  
For this activity, help the student to discuss in pair and reflect their answer to their classmates.  If 
the cell membrane is to lose its selectivity, all  substances may enter to the cell and all other 
substances which is important for the cell may remove out of the cell.  
Feedback to Activity 3.15  
Let the students share their reflection with their friends on:  
 Diffusion of the odor of incense stick from high  to low  concentration  
 Diffusion of tea color in cap of water from high to low  concentration  
Feedback to Activity 3.16  
Let the students exercise examples of diffusion in the classroom  
Diffusion  
The process  of diffusion  is explained  by using  perfume  spray  to show  the movement from high 
concentration to low concentration. In the activity, the smell of perfume moves from where it is 
sprayed to where it reaches the last student at the  corner.  
 You should  select  two students  for this activity;  the first student  works on the spraying of the 
perfume and the other one to count number during the activity. Let the students discuss on the 
result of the activity. The movement of the perfume smell becomes faster when we increase the 
concentration of perfume. This  indicate s that concentration of substances affect  diffusion.  
Osmosis  
Feedback to 3.17 Activity  
Let the students’ pair with their friends next to them. Then let them discuss about some examples  
  
GRADE 9 BIOLOGY TEACHER’S GUIDE  48 
 of osmosis, Feeling thirsty after having salty food because too much of  salty food disrupt the 
balance of fluid in your cells. The extra salt outside the cell acts like a magnet, pulling water out of 
the cells.  
The cells try to hold in the water and they send chemical messengers to the brain, protesting the 
saltiness of the f luid around them. When the thirst center goes on alert because things are too salty and 
the body needs water to dilute the salt, that’s when you start to feel thirsty. The kidneys help dilute the 
salt too by slowing down urine production and conserving wat er. The constant balancing of salt and 
water in the body helps maintain the right amount of water in our cells and in the bloodstream.  
Swelling  of resins  and other  seeds when  they are soaked  in water , this seed and the potato  swells 
because it takes wate r . 
Feedback to 3.18 Activity  
Let the students’ pair with their friends next to them. Then let them discuss about some examples 
of osmosis write short note and help them to read to other classmates. When osmosis explained 
in terms of the solutes, water mov es from the area of lower solute concentration (Hypotonic) 
toward the area with the greatest concentration of solutes (Hypertonic).  
Feedback to 3.19 Activity  
Let the students  form  a group  with the students  sitting  at the back seat. Help  them  to discuss  in 
groups  how osmosis  is important  in our society  in the preservation  of meat in the rural area where 
refrigerator is not  available. Here, many people live in a rural area preserve meat by mixing the cut 
meat with salt; here water moves from meat (high concen tration of water) to the salt ( low 
concentration of water but high concentration of salt).  
Feedback to 3.20 Activity  
Let the students form a group with the students sitting at the back seat. Help them to  discuss  in 
groups  and write  short  note of their discussion.    
In human, during physical activity, the body may sweat in order to maintain a stable  temperature.  
If liquids  are not drunk  to compensate  for water  loss through sweating,  the body  can become  
dehydrated.  Loss of water  from  the blood  results in  the plasma  becoming  more  concentrated  .The 
cells become  shrinks.  Their  surface area is reduced, causing them  to be less effective in carrying 
oxygen. The shape of the cells is known as being  crenate.  
When a farmer applies chemical fertilizers to the soil, the  fertilizers dissolve in the soil water. Too  
  
GRADE 9 BIOLOGY TEACHER’S GUIDE  49 
 much fertilizer can lower the osmotic potential of the soil water. This can draw water out of the 
plant root hair cells by osmosis, leading to wilting and death of crop  plants.  Why?  
This is because high amount o f fertilizer makes the soil to reduce its water con - centration.  This is 
because  of the addition  of solutes  as fertilizer  in the soil. Now, the movement of water is from high 
concentration (the plant) to low concentration (the soil). Therefore, the plant b ecomes wilt because 
it loses its water content by  osmosis.  
Feedback to 3.21 Activity  
Use internet or book for your source and discuss how animals living in fresh water regulate osmosis 
and how they protect their body from bursting?  
Fresh water animals thes e animals must have a way to balance the uptake and  loss of water. The 
control of water balance is called osmoregulation. For example, a freshwater fish has kidneys and 
gills that work constantly to prevent an excessive buildup of water in the  body.  
Activ e transport  
Active transport uses a substance called ATP as the en ergy supply for this process.  Active 
transport is carried out by   proteins in membranes, usually called pump proteins. The membranes 
of cells contain many different pump proteins allowing the cel l to control the content of its 
cytoplasm precisely . The molecule or ion enters the pump protein and can reach as far as a central 
chamber. A conformational change to the protein takes place using energy from ATP. After this, 
the ion or molecule can  pass to the opposite side of the membrane and the pump protein returns 
to its original conformation.

iv. put the potato cubes in distilled water and salt solution.  
v. Let them speculate what will  happen?  
vi.  After 1  hour observe their difference in size, weig ht, and conclude.  
Answer:  the potato  which  is put in salt solution  losses  water  by osmosis.  There - fore, the weight  
decreases.

Feedback to Activity 3.22 Laboratory activity  
Investigating  osmosis  using model cell called dialysis tubing is partially permeable. We can use 
dialysis tubing to represent the cell membrane and the solution inside it to represent the cytoplasm.  
If finding of the dialysis tube is difficult, it is better to use the intestine of sheep or ox from the 
butchers found in your surrounding ). Tube  A increases in volume because water enters the tube 
into the ‘cell’ by osmosis and  , which becomes stretched. Tube B decreases in volume because 
water leaves out of  the tube by osmosis  
 Levels of Biological Organization

Feedback to Activity 4.10: Concept mapping  
The menstrual cycle is the series of changes that the female body experiences each month. These 
changes include producing an egg and preparing the uterus for receiving the egg. Once an egg has 
been released during ovulation, the part of the follicle that remains in the ovary develops into the 
corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is a structure that secre tes the two female hormones estrogen 
and progesterone. Progesterone causes changes to occur in the lining of the uterus. These changes 
prepare the uterus to receive a fertilized egg. The menstrual cycle begins during puberty. It will 
continue for 30 to 40 years. It stops at menopause . At menopause, the female stops releasing eggs 
and the secretion of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone decreases.

Feedback to  Activity 4.12: Jigsaw groups  
 The sperm then enters the cytoplasm of the ovum and the male nucleus of the sperm fuses 
with the female nucleus. This is the moment of fertilization. The released ovum is thought 
to survive for about 24 hours; the sperm might be able to fertilize an ovum for about 2 or 3 
days. So there is only a short period of about 4 days each month when fertilization might 
occur. If this fertile period can be estimated accurately, it can be used either to achieve or to 
avoid fertilization (c onception).  
 The fertilized ovum (zygote) first divides into two cells. Each of these divides again, so 
producing four cells. The cells continue to divide in this way to produce a solid ball of cells, 
an early stage in the development of the embryo. This ea rly embryo travels down the oviduct 
to the uterus. Here it sinks into the lining of the uterus, a process called implantation . The 
embryo continues to grow and produces new cells that form tissues and organs. After 8 
weeks, when all the organs are formed, the embryo is called a foetus .

1. Answer:  The sperm then enters the cytoplasm of the ovum and the male nucleus of the sperm 
fuses with the female nucleus.   
2. Answer:  Sperms are smaller in size compared to the egg, as the egg contains reserved food for 
the developing embryo.  
3. Answer:  A follicle is a group of epithelial cells. These epithelial cells surround a developing 
egg cell. FSH also causes a hormone called estrogen to be released from the ovary. Estrogen 
is a steroid hormone responsible for the secondary sex char acteristics of females. These 
characteristics include the growth and maintenance of female sex organs. As in males, 
secondary sex characteristics include an increase in growth rates of the long bones of the arms 
and legs. In females, however, and unlike ma les, the hips broaden, and more fat is deposited 
in the breasts, buttocks, and thighs. The menstrual cycle begins.

GRADE 9 BIOLOGY TEACHER’S GUIDE  68 
 i. Fission :  In binary fission  the body of the unicellular parent divides by mitosis into two 
approximately equal parts, ea ch of which grows into an individual similar to the parent. 
Alternatively, the nucleus of the orgasms divide repeatedly and each daughter nucleus 
breaks away together with a small portion of the cytoplasm, resulting in the production of 
many daughter cells . 
ii. Fragmentation: Fragmentation is one of the most common modes of asexual reproduction 
involving the breakdown of a parent organism into parts that develop into whole organism  
iii. Parthenogenesis: a form of asexual reproduction in which an unfertilized egg dev elops into 
an adult organism.  
iv. Budding: During the process a bulge forms on the side of the cell, the nucleus divides 
mitotically, and the bud ultimately detaches itself from the mother cell.  
v.  Vegetative propagation: Is a method of asexual reproduction in plants where structures 
with lateral meristems such as roots, stems, buds, and leaves give rise to new self -
supporting individual. The following are types of vegetative reproduction.  
6. Answer:  Once an egg has been released during ovulation, the part of the follicle that remains 
in the ovary develops into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is a structure that secretes 
the two female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone causes changes to occur 
in the lining of the uterus. These changes prepare th e uterus to receive a fertilized egg.  
7. FSH stimulates maturation of an ovarian follicle. The interval of follicle maturation before 
ovulation is the follicular phase of the cycle. During this time, cells around the egg secrete 
estrogens that stimulate the e ndometrium to thicken. The rise in estrogens encourages the 
pituitary to release more LH. The flow of LH causes the follicle to swell and burst. LH trigger 
for ovulation. The luteal phase of the cycle begins after ovulation. LH stimulates formation of 
the corpus luteum, which secretes some estrogens and a lot of progesterone. These hormones 
cause the uterine lining to thicken and encourage blood vessels to grow through it. The uterus 
is now ready for pregnancy.  
8. Testosterone : main hormone produced by testes;  required for sperm production and 
development of male secondary sexual traits.  
9. The hormones cause the uterine lining to thicken and encourage blood vessels to grow through 
it. The uterus is now ready for pregnancy.

11. Answer:  
a. Vasectomy: This is a simple and safe surgical operation in which the man’ s sperm ducts are 
cut and the ends sealed. This means that his semen contains the secretions of the prostate 
gland and seminal vesicle but no sperm so cannot fertilize an ovum. Sexual desire, erection, 
copulation and ejaculation are quite unaffected. The t estis continues to produce sperm and 
testosterone. The sperm are removed by white cells as fast as they form. The testosterone 
ensures that there is no loss of masculinity. The sperm ducts can be rejoined by surgery but 
this is not always successful.  
b. Diap hragm : A thin rubber disc, placed in the vagina before intercourse, covers the cervix 
and stops sperm entering the uterus. Condoms and diaphragms, used in conjunction with 
chemicals that immobilize sperm, are about 95% effective. However, a diaphragm does not 
prevent the risk of transmission of STIs (Fig. 4.16).  There are no side effects , offers some 
protection against cervical cancer. It must  be initially fitted by a doctor. May be incorrectly 
positioned or damaged and allow sperm past. Gives better prote ction against pregnancy 
when combined with spermicide. There is a chance of 2.5 pregnancies per 100 woman years.  
c. contraceptive pill:  The pill contains chemicals, which have the same effect on the body as 
the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. When mixed in suitable proportions these 
hormones suppress ovulation and so prevent conception. The pills need to be taken each 
day for the 21 days between menstrual periods. There are many varieties of contraceptive 
pill in which the relative proportions of oestroge n- and progesterone -like chemicals vary. 
They are 99% effective, but long -term use of some types may increase the risk of cancer of 
the breast and cervix. The pill does not protect against STIs.  
d. Spermicides : Spermicides are chemicals which, though harmles s to the tissues, can kill or 
immobilize sperm. The spermicide, in the form of a cream, gel or foam, is placed in the 
vagina. On their own, spermicides are not very reliable but, in conjunction with condoms 
or diaphragms, they are effective.

 e. Laparotomy : A woman may be sterilized by an operation in which her oviducts are tied, 
blocked or cut. The ovaries are unaffected. Sexual desire and menstruation continue as 
before, but sperm can no longer reach the ova. Ova are released, but break down in the 
upper part  of the oviduct. The operation cannot usually be reversed. Both vasectomy  and 
laparotomy  are a lmost 100% guaranteed to prevent pregnancy and permanent control of 
fertility. Remove the problem of human error in contraception. For women in particular it 
involves a general an aesthetic. Not easily reversible. There a chance of 0.05 pregnancies 
per 100 woman years.

Feedback to Activity 5.9 
Let the students work in pair and, then let them discuss, write short note and read it to the class.  
Answer: Yes it causes malnutrition because of excessive feeding. This leads to  obesity. 
Activity    5.10    Obesity 
This activity explains how obesity is formed which is the imbalance between the energy stored and 
released by the body. An increase in consumption of high -energy foods without an equal increase 
in physical activity leads to an unhealthy increase in weight. In other way, decreased levels of 
physical activity can also result in an energy imbalance and leads to weight  gain. 
In this activity, you can make a discussion  
Group work: Let the stu dents to form a group; then,  help them to discuss in groups and write short 
note of their discussion.  
Sitting and watch TV: This may leads to obesity because there is a formation  of stored energy 
because energy is saved as a result of sitting to watch  TV. 
Playing  football  in the field:  this may not lead to obesity  because  playing  football can result the 
releasing of much  energy  
Playing  computer  games:  This may leads  to obesity  because  energy  is reserved  as a result of less 
activity; therefore energy is store d and leads to  obesity.  
Going to school by Walking: this may not produce obesity because it release ex cess energy because 
of walking  
Going to school by taxi: this may lead to obesity because energy preserved be - cause of going to 
school by  taxi

Feedback to Activity 6.13: Collaborative learning groups  
o Disturbed area may be colonized by a variety of species, which are gradually replaced by 
other species, which are in turn replaced by still other species —a process called ecological 
succession . When this process begins in a virtually lifeless area, such as on a new volcanic 
island or on the rubble (moraine) left by a retreating glacier, it is called primary 
succession. In contrast to primary succession, secondary succession involves the 
recolonization of an area after a major disturbance has removed most but no t all of the 
organisms in a community.  
 
Feedback to self -test  
1. Secondary succession  
2. succession: the orderly, natural changes that take place in the communities of an 
ecosystem

o Interspecific interactions include competition, predation, herbiv ory, parasitism, 
mutualism, and commensalism. Interactions ould have positive (+) or negative ( -) effects 
on the survival and reproduction of individuals engaged in the interaction. For example, 
predation  is a +/ - interaction, with a positive effect on the  survival and reproduction 
of members of the predator population and a negative effect on members of the prey 
population. Mutualism  is a +/+ interaction in which the survival and reproduction of 
individuals of each species is increased in the presence of t he other.

1. Interspecific interactions include competition, predation, herbivory, parasitism, mutualism, 
and commensalism. Interactions ould have positive (+) or negative ( -) effects on th e 
survival and reproduction of individuals engaged in the interaction. For example, predation 
is a +/ - interaction, with a positive effect on the survival and reproduction of members of 
the predator population and a negative effect on members of the prey p opulation. 
Mutualism is a +/+ interaction in which the survival and reproduction of individuals of 
each species is increased in the presence of the other.  
2. Wildebeests and zebras, and predators, including lions and hyenas, are common 
inhabitants  
3. Cattle ran ching and overhunting  
4. Many species are nocturnal. Water conservation is a common adaptation, with some 
species surviving solely on water obtained from breaking down carbohydrates in seeds.
